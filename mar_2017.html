<p>March has started and it's the 3rd and already I feel that I'm in catch up mode. I'm behind with both website work and with wheels and all I seem to be doing is to be writing to clients telling them that it's going to take me a bit longer. My wheel clients seem to be fine with this situation but it's not the case with the web clients. Now that I'm better healthwise I really don't have any excuses except to get on with the work but at the same time I don't want to be neglecting my goals.</p>
<p>It's the 12th of March and only 4 days since I last updated, i.e. when I finally got down to setting all of my goals for the month. I have to say that I got quite excited about it which can only mean that I was recovering from my illnesses and gradually rebuilding my routines. I still feel excited and feel that I'm 'on the case' as it were. They all feel achievable and realistic which gives me a great deal of confidence.</p>
<p>It's the 23rd so I guess that means 3 weeks are have passed since the start of the month and it's been 8 days since I last reported looking at my git log. I was excited last time but I seem to have lost it again. I feel lost and wondering what the hell I'm doing. Everything seems a bit pointless but I know it's just something that I feel every now and again so I'm not doing anything about it but simply letting myself feel it. It does however sap ones energy and leaves one with a great yearning for junk food and TV. I watched a whole season of Iron Fist which with 13 episodes comes to over 13 hours. I know I said that I wanted to lower my expectations but it's not that easy. Even though I've set easier goals than last year I still expect myself to at least try to achieve them and to a greater extent I am doing that but unless I score high, I can't help but feel that I'm not doing very well at all. I'm wondering if a lot of my motivation to excel and improve comes from a need of attention from my father who rarely took an interest in what I was up to as a youngster so it doesn't really matter how well I do at anything because he still wouldn't be interested but part of me believes that is the way and that if I were to really impress him then he would be proud and he would say so. It's never going to happen and I need to face that. I need to work toward my goals only for myself and also not as a means to an end. Watching TV for hours during my youth (and later years) was something that made me very guilty but I'm starting to get more comfortable with it nowadays albeit slowly.</p>
<p>For the final week of March I end on a high, feeling that my health and motivation are coming back and that I can fully engage with my goals; that I can commit to those things that I really want to pursue and also be clear about the things that no longer interest me.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>This month I simply want to attend my scheduled duties and do nothing else: no mentoring, no meetings or working on anything that is outside of the regular scheduled duty supporting callers. As I'm part of the branch Twitter team I guess I will be tweeting a bit but other than that I really want to step back from it all.</p>
    <p>I've told the branch director that I want to step down from my leadership roles and there was a call for mentors for next group which will be starting soon. It's a large group and I do feel a little guilty about not putting myself forward but I want a little break from it all and just focus on my duties for now.</p>
    <p>During my last two duties I really wanted to take some calls but for some reason I started coughing just before my shift and of course that means I'm no good for calls and it persisted for the whole of that shift. Then on the next one I ended up doing some garden clearing at the branch, helping my mentee with safeguarding training and talking to another volunteer who I haven't seen for a while. Another occasion where I wanted to take calls but didn't. It was quite disappointing as that is the reason I chose to volunteer at Samaritans. It made me realise how much I really do want to drop all those other tasks and focus on supporting callers.</p>
    <p>I helped out with Skills Practice for the first time. It allowed the training group to safely try out answering a call and for me to give them some feedback. It reminded me of when I was training and seeing the group in the flesh made me think about taking on another mentee as I know that there are around 7 that still need mentors. But I said I would have a break before I do it again and the following day I felt that I should stick with that.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>No specific goal this month other than to continue with my 2 days per week schedule.</p>
    <p>I'm definitely doing more than my 2 a month and have decided to do 5 sets of 1 minute of Typetris and then in the Scout Mode section, I will focus more on accuracy over speed. It's pretty consistently in the upper fifties now and at least one exercise in each session is greater than or equal to sixty words per minute. I think it's more important to focus on accuracy over speed especially now that my speed is more than adequate for my day to day needs. I suppose that begs the question as to whether I need to practice at all. I believe that if I didn't practice then I would start to lose some of my speed and accuracy. But I also enjoy doing the practice and like the challenge of working towards getting better at it.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I just feel stuck: I don't seem to be getting any better or worse but looking at the figures it does seem that I am improving very slowly. That's encouraging I suppose otherwise it would be discouraging to find out that all this effort had been in vain.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>I really just want to tie up loose ends before starting on anything new. I had Git course on the go and was also working my way through the Mastering the Command Line book, so before I embark on any new courses of study I really would like to complete these that I have started first. Then I want to have a think about where to go next. I have been considering the idea of pursuing a Data Structures and Algorithms course. It would teach me to think more like a computer scientist but I don't want to start such a course and then find that I have stop. So my goal would be to figure out how much study would be required to start and to finish such a course.</p>
    <p>Even though my desire is strong I don't seem to be doing much about it, which is a bit odd. When I get like this I often ask myself whether I really want to do it or if it has something to do with it being potentially vocational. Either way, it's not happening and it's already almost halfway through the month. I'm sure it'll come back though.</p>
    <p>During the past week programming seemed to be well outside my radar and when I experienced some guilt while watching TV shows it didn't figure as something that I could or should be doing. It seems that it has dropped from passion to interest, which is a bit sad really but one can't force these things. I guess I'm just not as into it as I think I am or would like to be.</p>
    <p>I seem to have made zero progress this month and of course I am a little disappointed but not as much as I thought I would be. I'm starting to feel more and more comfortable with the idea of dropping this completely and disentangling it from any sort of career path but also as a source of entertainment or challenge.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>No particular goal this month other than to continue with my Dickens novel, Martin Chuzzlewit. It's more than likely that I will complete it by the end of the month even with my 20 - 30 minutes a day but I'm not going to set myself that goal. I'm not studying literature and I don't have a deadline to finish the book in time for a book club meeting. I'm reading for pleasure so it's about being in the right mood and stopping when that mood has expired.</p>
    <p>I've been enjoying my book and I have been reading far more than the goal of 20 - 30 minutes a day. I seem to like it more when he focuses more on the actual story rather than digressing on descriptions: they can be very long winded at times. Sometimes I get distracted during these passages but I need to stay attentive because suddenly a relevant aspect of the story will arise.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Saturday 11th, I received a book called Overcoming Gravity which I've mentioned in the Strength section. It's a veritable tome of a book and reminds me of my textbooks when I was at university many years ago. I've only done some random browsing so far but everything I read is like a gem. So for the next few weeks I will be reading this one in parallel with the Dickens.</p>
    <p>I have completed Martin Chuzzlewit and it ended very happily as in the Pickwick Papers. I immediately purchased and downloaded the next book in the series, Dombey and Son which I've now started. Today (15th) it was warm enough to sit in the garden and so I spent some time reading on my Kindle.</p>
    <p>I'm managing to read on a daily basis and really enjoying Dombey and Son. Some reviews on Amazon said that it was overly flowery and descriptive and omitting the narrative aspect to that extent. I haven't found it to be so and in fact less so that Martin Chuzzlewit. The story so far takes place in London and Brighton, both places where I've lived; the familiarity makes it even more engaging.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>This month will be trying to undo some of the damage from the comfort eating of last month. I also want to have a crack at completing 4 healthy eating days which I think I may achieve as I feel that I've had enough of eating chips and biscuits. I've also had rekindled enthusiasm of cooking which involves using fresh ingredients and as long as I don't overdo the fat and salt content I am avoiding pre-packed or processed food which tend to contain much of the contaminants that cause us harm.</p>
    <p>In a conversation with a friend we discussed the idea of Omega 3 deficiency and how it is widespread across Europe especially with middle aged people. I'm getting close to that age myself and even though I take cod liver oil on a daily basis perhaps it's not enough. They recommend eating some type of oily fish 2-3 times a week. Oily fish of all types is something that I enjoy very much but isn't at all part of my diet. I used to eat a smoked mackerel salad every Sunday but that was in 2009. It's time to bring back the fish.</p>
    <p>On Tuesday 7th I ate clean. Apart from a little Chorizo, a teaspoon of sugar in hot chocolate the rest was not any kind of pre-made food. I don't know if it's for this reason or another but I seem to be seeing a pattern emerging in that whenever I try and eat healthily I find myself with diarrhea the following day. Obviously this puts me off somewhat as it never happens when I eat dirty. But I'll keep trying. But that's one out of four completed.</p>
    <p>I had another day of eating extra Omega 3 and this time in the form of herring fillets or Kippers. I made a salad similar to the one I had on Tuesday but this time no bad stomach and in the evening I had chips from the Codfather near my Samaritans branch. I imagine then that the bad stomach was attributable to the last meal of the day on Tuesday which was the black eyed bean curry that I made.</p>
    <p>On Monday morning (13th) I weighed myself having not done so for many weeks because the batteries in my electronic scales seem be always flat. I think that even a small amount of vibration causes them switch on. I replaced the rechargeable batteries with regular ones (the ones that came with the scales) and stepped on them. I took repeated weighings on different areas of the floor and found that my weight was just under 64kg. My rule of thumb is that I aim to stay under the 60kg mark. Even though I have been fasting twice a week over the past few months the excess consumption of junk food hasn't gone unnoticed and left its calling card. I didn't feel too badly about it as while I was ill it gave me a good deal of pleasure where I couldn't find any elsewhere. I decided to take immediate action to get my weight under 60kg again: to fast for 3 days this week rather than 2 days and use MyFitnessPal to track my calories on my non-fasting days to make sure that I don't overeat. Yesterday, Tuesday, I managed to eat relatively clean with a small piece of cake at Samaritans and a couple of biscuits at home. Which even though is not 100% healthy, I will count as such. I also ate sardines for lunch and cooked for dinner. I was very pleased with that. I know that I still need to make room for junk food as it's a passion of mine but I think if I can limit it somewhat and keep track of the calories and compensate for it (eat a light salad for lunch if I'm going to have sausage and chips for dinner) then I should be inside my allowance.</p>
    <p>In week 3 I managed another healthy eating day and it was a Tuesday rather than a Wednesday as it was originally planned. I ate a Waldorf Salad for lunch and a black-eyed bean curry for dinner. Pineapple for snacks and I stayed within my calorie allowance too. The Wednesday and Thursday wasn't fully healthy but they weren't overly unhealthy either. Hopefully I can strike a good balance between healthy food and comfort food.</p>
    <p>Another healthy eating day in the final week of the month which means that I achieved my goal of 4 in the month but in actual fact there were other days where I ate healthily for 90% of the day. I was also cooking which made the meals more interesting and exciting. I don't think I can quit junk food completely and I did eat chips on the Thursday but it was only on one day rather than three. I know I can't expect this every month but this is a good start and I will be able to look back on it and think that it is actually possible without self flagellation or willpower.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I had to miss quite a few workouts in February due to being ill and just not having the energy or the motivation to do any training but this month my goal is to re-establish my strength to the level that it was before I had to stop and when I have done that I will then consider the Rings One course. But I've now decided against the Rings One course and opted for the Overcoming Gravity book which is already on its way from Amazon.co.uk.</p>
    <p>As I've mentioned in the Reading section, I've received the Overcoming Gravity book already and have started to dip into it. I'm not going to start making any changes to my routine until I've given it a thorough reading but so far I have gleaned that the handstand is an extremely important exercise and in gymnastics it is a core or foundation skill which is then a base for many others. As such it should be practiced every day. Only for 5-10 minutes a day so what I've decided to do is add it on to my yoga session and I'll say more about my plans there.</p>
<p>It's now the 15th and I've been reading more of the Overcoming Gravity book, which is all about gymnastics and bodyweight training but it's clear and systematic approach to this subject has already inspired me a great such that I am able to apply some of the principles to my other goals. One of these ideas is periodisation which I had read about before in 'The Cyclists Training Bible' but didn't really grasp how it would work. There are what are called microcycles which for ease of use are a week long and mesocycles which can be from 4-8 weeks and end with a 'deload' or rest week. Each microcycle is not the same in that even though the list of exercises in that workout may be the same, you could be working on different attributes such as endurance or hypertrophy. I had never really considered a rest week before but the thought of it sounds very refreshing. Another tried and tested technique for gaining strength is what is called 'Greasing the Groove' where you choose one exercise and work at a lower intensity but more frequently: multiple times a day and every day for the duration of a mesocycle. This idea also came as a breath of fresh air because it makes things a lot freer. One of my concerns has always been that I shouldn't exercise outside of my training session because it would hamper my recovery. But as strength is about building neural connections in order to recruit muscle this low intensity frequent work helps to entrench the movement and make it more and more familiar. It's something that I'm going to try this month and into April.</p>
<p>I think I went a bit overboard on the strength training having got this book, especially with the daily goals. My wrists are now hurting and I am going back to the chapter that I ignored about prehabilitation and injury prevention. As regards the 'greasing the groove' technique, I've had to hold back with that a bit too as I felt something pull or go in right shoulder during my very first dip during my workout. I'm not taking any risks or going to push myself through because if I do suffer a real and actual injury then I'm going to have to stop altogether. Other than the exercises and movements that seem to aggravate the shoulder everything else seems to be progressing well.</p>
<p>I took it slightly easier with the dips during the final week and cut out the daily handstands and the 'greasing the groove' way of working. I felt that it was the sensible thing to do as my goal is to increase my strength and not to incur injuries.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>No particular goal really other than to ride and possibly get on the rollers. Now that the weather is improving somewhat perhaps it's time for a ride, even a short one. I don't feel any urge to ride Audax as I did last year but I do want to ride and there were some elements of Audax that I do enjoy and miss when I can't or don't ride. Last week I only cycled once but I did enjoy that ride, so in the same way as I'm gradually rebuilding my strength training after being ill, I'll do the same with my cycling.</p>
    <p>I seem to be cycling once a week. Perhaps getting on the rollers even for 15 minutes on the days that I don't go out for a ride might be worthwhile.</p>
    <p>During week 3 I didn't cycle at all. I didn't even ride to my classes or to Samaritans. I wonder if I just need a longer break from it but I'm also concerned that I'm just no longer into it. I had a ride planned with friends on the 26th but they had to cancel. It was an opportunity to test out how I would feel on an actual ride after having not ridden for so long but I felt relieved to receive the news. That feeling of relief has worried me somewhat: what if I really am no longer interested in cycling? Could that be possible?</p>
    <p>I cycled once in week 4 which was nice but it does feel like something is missing when I don't even want to even commute. I guess I just have to be patient, after all, I did a lot of long distance riding over the past couple of years and it was my main priority: the interest could have dwindled just like that.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>I suppose I will carry on with my goal of throwing something out every day but try and focus more on the organising rather than the chucking out. I also have items that need to be sold, so perhaps a goal of one item to go on eBay or Amazon.</p>
    <p>I've put a philosophy book that I bought back in 2003 on Amazon. The recommended sale price was more than double what I originally paid for it so hopefully it will sell!</p>
    <p>When my daily reminder tells me to chuck or organise something I've been getting very annoyed with it because I feel that I have to find something quickly and then get on with whatever else I was doing. I've missed a few days and I'm feeling behind. But then I can't make up for the days that I've missed; those days are gone. It's hard not to beat myself up about it though.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>I seem to have gone back to yoga in front of the TV again. I don't seem to mind it too much but it then becomes more about the TV and less about the yoga. What I'd like to try this month is a routine that I do with my client on Thursdays who is away at the moment along with no TV but perhaps a podcast (or an audio book perhaps) and using a timer to remain in postures. Just for this month. That's realistic I think, as long as I have it in mind.</p>
    <p>I managed to have one session that was as I have described above but now that the Overcoming Gravity book has arrived and I have decided to set a goal of working on my handstands every day, I've added that work into my yoga session. What I did yesterday was to start my yoga session in the same way as I start my strength training session with some warm ups, wrist stretches and planks. Then come a few sets of handstands for 5-10 minutes. Hopefully this sort of preparation will allow me to focus more on the session itself rather than simply getting it done and being distracted while I did it. Another movement or posture that is both an important one gymnastics as it is in yoga is the bridge or the upside down bow. I haven't practiced this one for a very long time and when I gingerly attempted it yesterday I found that I wasn't able to get anywhere close to it! If you don't practice something then you do lose that ability but you keep telling yourself that you haven't lost it. I'm sure it will come back quickly though.</p>
    <p>The book also mentions that the splits is also very important but isn't something that I've practiced for a long time just like the bridge so I'll be adding that one to my routine too. I'm also not bothered about doing it front of the TV as I now have some clear goals and have been working on them.</p>
    <p>I cut back on the handstand practice after my wrists started to complain so that kind of threw me a bit in terms of how I would construct my session. There was some randomness again and at some point during the session I remembered that I would work on backbends and splits. Instead of TV I have been watching TED talks and it's easy to listen rather than watch which allows me to stay focused on the practice. The talks are very inspiring and actually help to engage with my yoga.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>I've been meaning to update my wheelbuilding website and have made some notes on how and what I need to change so I would really like to get that done this month.</p>
    <p>As for the other goals on my year plan list, I did visit a friend out of town this weekend on the 4th so that is one thing I can check off that one. I have been cooking already and made a nice Moong Dahl on Sunday 5th and plan to do more of that. I'm not ready to have my teeth done yet even though I can feel it's urgent. One thing I would like to do though is to eat out somewhere even if it's a regular spot such as Wagamama.</p>
    <p>I met up with some friends on Sunday evening and enjoyed some home cooking with them. It's lovely to meet some new people who are on the same wavelength as me. On Tuesday (14th) I made a kidney bean curry called 'Junjaro'. It was a very simple recipe but very tasty. It allowed me to eat healthily and also spend some time cooking.</p>
    <p>More cooking in week 3 with a repeat of the black-eyed been curry but this time with fresh dill as the recipe requires. It was good to improve upon certain recipes that I like. I also made a Waldorf Salad as I mentioned in the Diet section. Very healthy. I also made a pineapple smoothie.</p>
    <p>Even though I haven't thought about going on a meditation retreat which is one of my goals for the year, I have been doing it fairly regularly after my morning pages session. It's certainly not a goal but I seem to be gravitating towards it especially as I've been feeling stuck and lacking in purpose.</p>
    <p>The website update didn't happen. I didn't even look at it. I did think about it but for not more than say half an hour over the course of the whole month.</p>

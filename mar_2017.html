<p>March has started and it's the 3rd and already I feel that I'm in catch up mode. I'm behind with both website work and with wheels and all I seem to be doing is to be writing to clients telling them that it's going to take me a bit longer. My wheel clients seem to be fine with this situation but it's not the case with the web clients. Now that I'm beter healthwise I really don't have any excuses except to get on with the work but at the same time I don't want to be neglecting my goals.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>This month I simply want to attend my scheduled duties and do nothing else: no mentoring, no meetings or working on anything that is outside of the regular scheduled duty supporting callers. As I'm part of the branch Twitter team I guess I will be tweeting a bit but other than that I really want to step back from it all.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>No specific goal this month other than to continue with my 2 days per week schedule.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>I really just want to tie up loose ends before starting on anything new. I had Git course on the go and was also working my way through the Mastering the Command Line book, so before I embark on any new courses of study I really would like to complete these that I have started first. Then I want to have a think about where to go next. I have been considering the idea of pursuing a Data Structures and Algorithms course. It would teach me to think more like a computer scientist but I don't want to start such a course and then find that I have stop. So my goal would be to figure out how much study would be required to start and to finish such a course.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>No particular goal this month other than to continue with my Dickens novel, Martin Chuzzlewit. It's more than likely that I will complete it by the end of the month even with my 20 - 30 minutes a day but I'm not going to set myself that goal. I'm not studying literature and I don't have a deadline to finish the book in time for a book club meeting. I'm reading for pleasure so it's about being in the right mood and stopping when that mood has expired.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>This month will be trying to undo some of the damage from the comfort eating of last month. I also want to have a crack at completing 4 healthy eating days which I think I may achieve as I feel that I've had enough of eating chips and biscuits. I've also had rekindled enthusiasm of cooking which involves using fresh ingredients and as long as I don't overdo the fat and salt content I am avoiding pre-packed or processed food which tend to contain much of the contaminants that cause us harm.</p>
    <p>In a conversation with a friend we discussed the idea of Omega 3 deficiency and how it is widespead across Europe especially with middle aged people. I'm getting close to that age myself and even though I take cod liver oil on a daily basis perhaps it's not enough. They recommend eating some type of oily fish 2-3 times a week. Oily fish of all types is something that I enjoy very much but isn't at all part of my diet. I used to eat a smoked mackerel salad every Sunday but that was in 2009. It's time to bring back the fish.</p>
    <p>On Tuesday 7th I ate clean. Apart from a little Chorizo, a teaspoon of sugar in hot chocolate the rest was not any kind of pre-made food. I don't know if it's for this reason or another but I seem to be seeing a pattern emerging in that whenever I try and eat healthily I find myself with diarrhea the following day. Obviously this puts me off somewhat as it never happens when I eat dirty. But I'll keep trying. But that's one out of four completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I had to miss quite a few workouts in February due to being ill and just not having the energy or the motivation to do any training but this month my goal is to re-establish my strength to the level that it was before I had to stop and when I have done that I will then consider the Rings One course. But I've now decided against the Rings One course and opted for the Overcoming Gravity book which is already on its way from Amazon.co.uk.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>No particular goal really other than to ride and possibly get on the rollers. Now that the weather is improving somewhat perhaps it's time for a ride, even a short one. I don't feel any urge to ride Audax as I did last year but I do want to ride and there were some elements of Audax that I do enjoy and miss when I can't or don't ride. Last week I only cycled once but I did enjoy that ride, so in the same way as I'm gradually rebuilding my strength training after being ill, I'll do the same with my cycling.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>I suppose I will carry on with my goal of throwing something out every day but try and focus more on the organising rather than the chucking out. I also have items that need to be sold, so perhaps a goal of one item to go on eBay or Amazon.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>I seem to have gone back to yoga in front of the TV again. I don't seem to mind it too much but it then becomes more about the TV and less about the yoga. What I'd like to try this month is a routine that I do with my client on Thursdays who is away at the moment along with no TV but perhaps a podcast (or an audio book perhaps) and using a timer to remain in postures. Just for this month. That's realistic I think, as long as I have it in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>I've been meaning to update my wheelbuilding website and have made some notes on how and what I need to change so I would really like to get that done this month.</p>
    <p>As for the other goals on my year plan list, I did visit a friend out of town this weekend on the 4th so that is one thing I can check off that one. I have been cooking already and made a nice Moong Dahl on Sunday 5th and plan to do more of that. I'm not ready to have my teeth done yet even though I can feel it's urgent. One thing I would like to do though is to eat out somewhere even if it's a regular spot such as Wagamama.</p>

<p>Looking back over 2017 as I write this 2 weeks into December, all I can remember, especially as I have a cold right now, which has lasted a week, is that much of the year has been characterised by illness. Sometimes lasting a week, sometimes lasting longer and putting and putting a damper on my efforts to work at anything due to lack of energy, motivation and in great need of rest. Once the illness had passed I didn't quite snap back to my so-called normal mode but was much slower paced by the time I did get back to what I would consider normal, then lo and behold, I was sick again. I would have to refer to my monthly reports to get a more accurate picture of how many times I got sick and for how long each time but as a guess I would say at least 6 times and for about a week each time. That makes 42 days of being sick. As I have explained that doesn't necessarily mean 323 days of striving at maximum speed. Along with physical illness comes an emotional counterpart which gave rise to low mood, lack of motivation and a general sense of meaninglessness. Add to this an enforced house move following letters of eviction along with a long lapse from a regular yoga student both of which caused a great deal of anxiety. That was in May and it took a good while to settle and to absorb the impact of that event. That gives a general backdrop to the year.</p>
<p>I think that if I go through the year plan and comment on it looking back I can address everything blow by blow and then add concluding comments.</p>

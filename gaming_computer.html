<p>For many years, probably since 1999, I've been a console gamer, first on the original Playstation, then the Dreamcast, followed by the Xbox classic and then the Xbox 360. Unlike some gamers I didn't keep my previous consoles and only held on to a small subset of games that I like to play and ones that I regularly go back to. During 2016 I thought about diving into PC gaming having been put off in the past either by the perceived high cost or the amount of configuration required. I didn't now anyone that had a gaming PC so the only way was to research (reading forums and watching YouTube video) and making a desicion based on that. Another thing that was putting me off was that I didn't like the idea of playing with a mouse and keyboard. Some argued that it was superior to gaming with a controller, whether that was a valid point or not I didn't care, I wanted to play from my sofa rather than at my desk. I saw many videos where PC gamers did exactly that and seeing them do it made me feel a lot more comfortable about giving it a go. But the main thing that swayed me the most was the concept of super low budget gaming rigs. The proponents of this movement were using old computers, similar to my old Dell Optiplex that I've used to build my Hackintosh but with one major upgrade, the graphics card. It wasn't even a top of the range card as that wouldn't even work in such a low end PC but one that was a few years old but with only a few configuration tweaks it was possible to run many popular games and even some more recent titles. Obviously the bleeding edge titles or what they called the 'triple A' titles would probably require better hardware to make them playable but they showed that even those games could be played on lower settings with half decent playability. I was sold.</p>

<p>For many years, probably since 1999, I've been a console gamer, first on the original Playstation, then the Dreamcast, followed by the Xbox classic and then the Xbox 360. Unlike some gamers I didn't keep my previous consoles and only held on to a small subset of games that I like to play and ones that I regularly go back to. During 2016 I thought about diving into PC gaming having been put off in the past either by the perceived high cost or the amount of configuration required. I didn't know anyone that had a gaming PC so the only way was to research (reading forums and watching YouTube videos) and making a desicion based on that. Another thing that was putting me off was that I didn't like the idea of playing with a mouse and keyboard. Some argued that it was superior to gaming with a controller, whether that was a valid point or not I didn't care, I wanted to play from my sofa rather than at my desk. I saw many videos where PC gamers did exactly that and seeing them do it made me feel a lot more comfortable about giving it a go. But the main thing that swayed me the most was the concept of super low budget gaming rigs. The proponents of this movement were using old computers, similar to my old Dell Optiplex that I've used to build my Hackintosh but with one major upgrade: the graphics card. It wasn't even a top of the range card as that wouldn't even work in such a low end PC but one that was a few years old but with only a few configuration tweaks it was possible to run many popular games and even some more recent titles. Obviously the bleeding edge titles or what they called the 'triple A' titles would probably require better hardware to make them playable but they showed that even those games could be played on lower settings with half decent playability. I was sold.</p>
<p>I wanted to get a graphics card or GPU that would also work with a Hackintosh. After much research I settled on a workstation card made by ATI called the v5400 FirePro Radeon. Firstly I had to remove the long back plate in order for it to fit into my single slot machine and then spent rather a long time figuring out how to get it to work on my Hackintosh. I didn't succeed and even though I managed to get full resolution there was no Core Image or Quartz Extreme support. I continued to research but kept hitting brick walls and decided that my time might be better spent trying to find a different solution. I went through what other solutions might be viable. Here are a few that I considered. I could install another operating system on a different hard drive which would be exclusively for gaming and one that would work with Steam. I would then have to re-install my original Hackintosh compatible graphics card whenever I wanted to use that system, which I assumed would be most of the time. This was not a viable solution as it would involve taking the graphics card in and out. As yet I didn't know how much gaming I would do or if I'd even like it but even if it was only for a short time I wasn't comfortable with the idea of having to change the graphics card each time I used the computer. I would therefore need an operating system which would fully support the new card and allow me to use it in the way that I had been using it previously. On my laptop I use Linux Ubuntu and it was my preferred choice over Windows and Steam OS. While I was installing it on a new drive I neglected to follow my own advice of removing my main drive and ended up deleting all of my data!</p>
<p>I had two sets of recent backups so things were not as disastrous as they might sound. I did actually try installing Windows 7 (even though I don't really like Windows) because there are more games available for it but more research on my part showed that support for gaming on Linux based systems has come a long way so I decided to jump ship and commit myself fully to Linux Ubuntu. Having installed the main system my aim was to keep it as minimal as possible and to that end I installed all of the tools that I have set up and am familiar with on my laptop such as Vim, Git, Tmux, Zsh along with a small subset of files from my back up drive excluding things such as music and movies which tend to remain purely as archives. I rarely listen to music files that I have on my computer opting to listen mainly to online radio stations and as for movies I opt instead for streaming them online, which makes the files redundant (except of course when the internet is down, which seldom happens). Next I installed the Steam client. This went very smoothly and I proceeded to download a couple of simple low cost games just to see how my new system would perform. I got Bit Blaster XL, a retro arcade shooter similar to the classic, Asteroids and Hyper Space Pinball. Both worked fine but firstly only with the keyboard. I wanted however to use my Xbox controller. I got the driver from the Ubuntu Software Centre and it worked flawlessly. I was sitting on my sofa playing pinball and having a blast. However, this wasn't a big upgrade from the Xbox 360, so it was time to put it to the test with a game that would push it performance wise and offer me a gaming experience far superior to that of the Xbox 360. I chose the Tomb Raider reboot as it had full controller support and it was also in the Steam autumn sale which meant that I was able to purchase it for only &pound;4.00.</p>
<p>After some initial teething troubles and configuration issues with the game I got it working. It was more than playable: the game looked great both visually and in its narrative. It was a truly immersive experience and kept me up late for many nights till I reached its conclusion. My new gaming system had been well and truly tested and my conclusion was that it was true: one could have the high end graphics experience on a low budget system; great gaming at a low price. I wasn't about to throw out the Xbox but I was willing to invest more time into PC gaming and that meant more games. Up till now I had installed the system on a small spare hard drive but if I was going to use this computer as my main system and continue to add games then I would need a bigger, faster hard drive. As my previous drive was no longer usable I decided to clone my current drive (160GB) to my old Seagate Momentus 500GB hybrid SSD drive. Next I considered a better graphics card. It would have to be a single slot card that also wouldn't require a new power supply and after much research and weighing up of factors I settled on the NVIDIA GTX 750 ti with 2 GB. Even though it was a dual slot height most forums I read said that it would fit into a single slot machine such as my Dell Optiplex 755 and also run happily without extra power. I bought it for myself as a Christmas present in 2016. I bought a graphics card slot extender ribbon cable just in case and used it initially to try it out. But with a bit of trial and error and finally swapping the faceplate for a single slot one I managed to fit it snugly inside the machine and close the cover. It cost &pound;85.00 second hand which doesn't seem to very low budget but I sold the FirePro card at nearly the price I paid for it (around &pound;30.00) and I got a cheque for &pound;40.00 from my father which made the outlay very manageable. The upgrade was very noticeable: graphics were much improved and it was also quieter than the FirePro card which had a very whiny sounding cooling fan that was reminiscent of a dentist's drill.</p>
<p>Merely getting a new and improved GPU would only serve as a part Christmas present: no use without some games to play. Luckily I was able to browse the Steam Christmas sale and bought myself a whole host of games, which to date (April 2017) I still haven't played. Some of them I bought mainly because they were on offer and I knew I would play them at some point and others I knew I wanted to play there and then. One such game was Mad Max. It wasn't long till I was fully immersed in it, driving around the barren desert wasteland looking for scrap and taking down strongholds. As well as this game I also plunged into Saints Row IV which also kept me up till 03:00 on most nights. But suddenly it all stopped. I got the lurgy and just needed rest. When I have a cold sitting on the sofa staring at a screen isn't that big of a deal but this was worse than a cold and it greatly sapped my strength. Not only that but it also lasted a long time, long enough for me to lose that connection.</p>
<p>Whether or when that connection will return I know not but do know that it will. I tend to live my life in phases and immerse myself fully as I have described above and then not at all. I have no regrets about embracing Ubuntu and rarely miss my Hackintosh system. It's interesting how short term temporary solutions can become long term and more permanent. But that's a topic for another post.</p>

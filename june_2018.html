<p>I've really missed looking at my goals during May and even though I did sort of set them in my mind I wasn't checking in with myself in this way which I do find very beneficial.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sell books, guitar, toaster</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue but be more flexible</p>
    <p>Try a new recipe, extend the eating window to be more flexible when needed, only have a cheat if itâ€™s social, try a different meal at the shop or eat later on (extending the window rather than eat the mozzarella &amp; avocado).</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: PJS Premium</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue to read Little Dorrit, set a Reading Day</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Follow the ETK RKC PM</p>
    <p>I have noticed that I'm not really missing the bodyweight training and the kettlebell is starting to feel lighter. Pavel says that there is no rush and that one should focus on technique.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Add other postures (80/20) to my current program</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Arise at 6.30 each day. Get headset replaced on orange bike.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Paused goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Cycling, Guitar, Meditation, Samaritans, Sleep, Typing, Walking</p>
    <p>With so many goals on pause it raises the question as to whether these should even remain in the plan. Aside from meditation and guitar which I'm pretty sure will get the chop, the others are on the borderline. Even though I am currently not focused on them they could easily be resurrected in the same way that programming has become a major focus again. What I do like about this pausing of goals is that it's easy to delineate my level of engagement and assign my resources accordingly. All of the goals that I care a lot about at the moment are certainly not things that I feel I ought to be doing or that would be good for me: I'm pursuing them because at the moment they feel very worthwhile. At one time it was the same with the ones that I have put on pause.</p>

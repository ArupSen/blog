<p>I've really missed looking at my goals during May and even though I did sort of set them in my mind I wasn't checking in with myself in this way which I do find very beneficial.</p>
<p>The fact that I have to write something makes me think about what I might write and as it is about my goals it makes me think about my goals.</p>
<p>It was nice to have a proper break this weekend (9/10) and generally drop things that I would normally be working on such as yoga, reading and programming too. Good to have some quality time with my daughter and step back from all the stuff that I need to do.</p>
<p>At the end of week 3, today being the 18th of June I feel that my progress is going rather well. It feels that my goals are all feeding into each other and supporting each other but at the same time there are many changes going on both at home and at work. I tend to leave work (building wheels, yoga teaching and building websites) out of my goals but they are things that I need to do and get done so I think that it is something that I want to bring into my goals but not quite sure how that will happen.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sell books, guitar, toaster</p>
    <p>Only the start of week one (4th of June) and I've got rid of my DVD drawers where I used to store all those DVD's that I never watched and I've also sold a book on eBay and posted it this morning. It was Overcoming Gravity which I bought fairly recently but now that I have developed an interest in kettle bell training I have pretty much committed to it and all but quit the gymnastics and bodyweight training program.</p>
    <p>I went through a box of files and have destroyed and discarded a good deal of paperwork. I also went through some of my daughters things with her to see what she doesn't want any more: there were a good amount of books and a keyboard too. I'm planning to set up my wheel building workshop in my bedroom so I'm trying to remove as much as I can from there. I have a lot of books some of which I can sell and others that I could take to charity.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue but be more flexible</p>
    <p>Try a new recipe, extend the eating window to be more flexible when needed, only have a cheat if itâ€™s social, try a different meal at the shop or eat later on (extending the window rather than eat the mozzarella &amp; avocado).</p>
    <p>I tried having pate on Tuesday while I was out at Samaritans and had no ill effects. Also on Thursday evening I had sausages. A whole pack was perhaps a bit much but then I have lost a bit more weight than I needed to lose so I think I can afford to indulge a little. I've also been experimenting with Mascarpone as an alternative to cream. I've tried having extra thick cream and it seems to go straight through me but Mascarpone is cheese and I seem to be fine no matter how much cheese I eat. I made a kind of mousse au chocolat with it using cocoa powder and a sweetener called xylitol.</p>
    <p>As well as keto I'm also following the 16:8 intermittent fasting protocol on the days that I'm not doing the 5:2. The main thing with that is figuring out the 'eating window' which of course is 8 hours. On the days when I'm at home that is fairly easy and generally I've been leaving it at late as possible because that leaves my morning free and I enjoy eating later on in the day. But on the days that I've been working at the shop what I've been doing is to have my first meal around 930 which means that I need to be done by 530pm and often I haven't finished work by then so I need to eat at the shop. What I've been doing is to eat an avocado and mozzarella salad and then return home. But I've been thinking about this strategy and out of the two meals that I eat I feel that it is the evening meal that is not very satisfying. What I mean is that I miss out on evening meal at home eating pork shoulder steaks and broccoli and I miss that meal more than the breakfast meal of bacon and eggs. What I've been trying out is simply to leave the breakfast till later as I do on the days when I'm at home so that I can enjoy the more indulgent evening meal. What I was having as the evening meal I now have as the breakfast and it frees up my morning and I can leave the house at any time and not worry about the eating window. I can also increase the fasting period if I wanted to by eating the evening meal earlier.</p>
      <p>I followed this strategy on Sunday (10th) when I had a picnic in the park and my breakfast was around 230pm and comprised of cheese, pate and avocado along with a few cherry tomatoes. I felt perfectly satiated and very soon any sense of hunger disappeared. This was similar to the previous day (Saturday 9th) when I went to Brighton for the day and my breakfast was at around 1pm and comprised of avocado and cheese slices. I didn't eat dinner till I got home that day at around 9pm and found that I didn't have too much of an appetite and could easily have missed it without noticing it. I experienced a similar feeling on Sunday (10th) evening but I did feel like eating rather than feeling hungry.</p>
      <p>I've been eating a lot of nuts particularly cashews, which are very moreish and delicious but they do contain a lot of carbs and given the amount that I eat when I make a start means that I get kicked out of ketosis and even though I'm enjoying it I am not really following my diet as strictly as I should. I know that I'm being a bit more lenient this month but I can see this easily getting out of hand. So if I can resist I am doing so and eating cheese or pork scratchings instead.</p>
      <p>Leaving my breakfast or my first meal till later on in the day, say between 1 and 2pm seems to be working really well. It means that I can have my later meal later on i.e. closer to when I want to go to bed as I used to do or earlier and still remain inside my eating window. It affords me a large block of uninterrupted time with no hunger or cravings during that time. Even strenuous activities seem to be fine. I miss my bacon and eggs breakfast a little bit but not that much. Some days I just snack on cheese and nuts along with buttery scrambled eggs and having been watching videos about the carnivore diet I am less concerned about getting an array of vegetables. In fact it is something that I'd like to try at some point, perhaps later this year. So simple and potentially very healthy too.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: PJS Premium</p>
    <p>I've jumped into this with both feet. I'm really loving the leaps in understanding especially after all these years of trying to make progress with my programming studies. The teacher is amazing both in his teaching method and the content of the course. The community is also really great and they all see the potential of adhering to this philosophy of real progress over assumed knowledge. I'm making a big effort to be consistent and attending the daily accountability meetings which are at 4.00pm in the UK.</p>
    <p>I have worked my way through section one which was learning how to read a codebase. The premise is that you will spend more time reading code than writing it so one needs to build up those skills: what to look out for and what to ignore. You will be asked to fix bugs or add features and to that end it would mean getting a good understanding of the existing codebase. Some large codebases are hundreds if not thousands of lines long and also include libraries: where would you even start? A good deal of new and foreign material to digest.</p>
    <p>As well as being immersed in this section one material I have also been getting a general overview of the course as a whole and dipping into later parts of the course. There is a lot of material but the main feature of this course aside from the excellent teaching is the community. There is a group of very dedicated learners and we have connected on Slack. Since Tuesday though I haven't been able to participate in the daily accountability meetings at 4.00pm (in the UK) and have been wondering about the Office Hours on Monday which would be at 02:00 on a Tuesday in the UK. I do an overnight at Samaritans every 8 weeks on a Tuesday morning from 01:00 - 07:00 so I'm sure I could fit in one a month. You hear of people at startups pulling an all-nighter once a week.</p>
    <p>With all the current concerns about work and home I haven't been quite as focused on the course as I would like to have been. I'm currently working through the testing series. I was falling asleep during a couple of my study sessions which makes me wonder about my energy levels. Perhaps I'm just bored.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue to read Little Dorrit, set a Reading Day (16th)</p>
    <p>I've been reading on the tube and really enjoying Little Dorrit. Seem to be falling asleep when I read but that might just be the tube though.</p>
    <p>I'd like to be a little more consistent with this as I am with my other goals but I am a little bit loathed to set a time or a particular slot which is my reading time. I want it to be more of a natural thing but then that more organic approach isn't really working. Perhaps I need a way to schedule this that doesn't feel like it is forced or artificial in any way. How would I do that?</p>
    <p>Saturday 16th was meant to be my Reading Day but I had my daughter for a bit longer than usual, actually for most of the day, so I didn't really get much done. In terms of reading rather than a small amount it was zero. I really don't want to miss it this month as I've been reading a lot more than last month.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Follow the ETK RKC PM</p>
    <p>I have noticed that I'm not really missing the bodyweight training and the kettlebell is starting to feel lighter. Pavel says that there is no rush and that one should focus on technique.</p>
    <p>I may be going a bit faster that I'm ready because on Saturday 2nd and Monday 4th I twinged my lower back a little bit. Need to be careful though as if I get an injury that's training out for a while.</p>
      <p>I've been finding that if I work too hard on the presses on the day that I'm working on the Turkish Get Up my arm gets very shaky and on a couple of occasions I have ended up dropping the bell. It was good in a way in that it showed me what would happen in that scenario but it was also discouraging and felt that I had made a backward step. To remedy this what I'm doing is to ease back on the presses on my TGU days so I can put more energy and effort into the TGU itself. In general I'm improving a great deal with the cleans and presses and the added pull-up on each 'rung' of the ladder. So, overall it's going really well.</p>
      <p>I watched some videos on the clean as I'm still not really getting the hang of it and bashing the back of my wrist. Still, I seem to be good on some reps. My handstands also seem to be a bit stagnant but I am enjoying them. I thought of removing them at one point as they aren't really part of the kettlebell program but as I'm so consistent with them I've decided to leave them in.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Add other postures (80/20) to my current program</p>
    <p>I'm using the timer again as I do with my strength training so it's an easy way to let go and focus for that duration.</p>
    <p>Over the weekend (9/10) I only did a minimal amount of yoga and pretty much skipped it on Friday and Sunday. Somehow I seem to find it more difficult to do when my daughter is around but not always but Friday evenings seem to be becoming a bit of a trend.</p>
    <p>My yoga sessions have descended again into a stretching session in front of the screen watching an episode of something. I guess it's better than missing it but I do find it disappointing as I'm so focused when it comes to my strength training and earlier this year I did for a time have a more focused routine using the timer and doing the corpse at the end.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Arise at 6.30 each day. Get headset replaced on orange bike.</p>
    <p>I haven't been setting my alarm but as it's summer I seem to be up early anyway, well before 06:30 and it's great to have so much time when normally I wouldn't even be awake. I also have extra time from the 16:8 diet due not eating till 13:00 so I'm really enjoying being an early riser.</p>
    <p>I still haven't set the alarm as I haven't really needed to do it. This morning for example I was up early at 05:30 so for the summer time anyway I think this regime should be pretty easy. There was even one day when I got into work at 07:30.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Paused goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Cycling, Guitar, Meditation, Samaritans, Sleep, Typing, Walking</p>
    <p>With so many goals on pause it raises the question as to whether these should even remain in the plan. Aside from meditation and guitar which I'm pretty sure will get the chop, the others are on the borderline. Even though I am currently not focused on them they could easily be resurrected in the same way that programming has become a major focus again. What I do like about this pausing of goals is that it's easy to delineate my level of engagement and assign my resources accordingly. All of the goals that I care a lot about at the moment are certainly not things that I feel I ought to be doing or that would be good for me: I'm pursuing them because at the moment they feel very worthwhile. At one time it was the same with the ones that I have put on pause.</p>
    <p>Although the above goals are on pause two have sort of become resurrected and I feel I should comment on another one. I cycled 3 times last week, all commuting but it didn't in any way feel like a big deal or that it was out of the ordinary. I was a bit slower than I was when I was doing it more regularly but didn't feel that I needed to be any faster than I was. I even thought about going on a longer ride: a 300km on the 1st of July. Arrivee magazine from Audax arrived and I feel inspired again. A 300km ride with a night section may not perhaps be the best way to step back into the fray but who knows!</p>
    <p>Even though walking has also slipped off my radar I still end up walking more than 10k steps at least twice a week and I check my Pedometer app to see how I did. The app has various challenges such streaks, stair climbing and various other awards. They actually seem to be rather motivating and so are spurring me on to do it. On Sunday 18th morning I noticed that on the Saturday I had walked more than 15k steps and there is a challenge called the "Weekend Walker" which involves walking more than 15k steps on the two consecutive days over a weekend. I walked early in the morning on Sunday to reach 12k steps and then later on to surpass 15k and reach 21k. Walking does take a lot of time so I don't really want to reinstate it as a goal but I do feel motivated to dip into these challenges.</p>
    <p>I have noticed that prior to my last two shifts at Samaritans I just didn't feel like going and when I was there I was very preoccupied and so wasn't able to fully focus on the caller. I felt as though I was the one needing the support. I therefore decided to take a sabbatical. It's going to last about 10 weeks taking me up to August 26th. That'll hopefully give me enough time to focus on the things that are concerning me at present and then return to my duties with renewed vigour.</p>

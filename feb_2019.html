<p>We're almost at the end of February and in general I have to say that the month has been going well. My energy and motivation have been really high and I think that is the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. The so called positive feedback loop is definitely working and the more success I achieve in what I set out to do, the more I feel inclined to do it. Let's get started with my list of goals and how I did in each.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>I have decided to expand myself into the whole flat. Since my flatmate moved out in September 2018 I have been keeping that room empty in anticipation of a new one. Having made the decision to live on my own and somehow earn the extra money meant that I can now use that room as well as the storage space reserved for a flatmate. I did discard a small amount of things but it has been more about repurposing and restructuring my space. What was my bedroom and wheel building workshop is now purely my workshop: wheels, tools, cardboard boxes and miscellaneous storage. What was my flatmate's room is now my bedroom. I have also discovered that I have an attic and within the space of a week my flat has expanded. There are items that need to go and being able to now put them out of sight does risk that they get forgotten but at least it is a lot more and better organised.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: start commuting again</p>
    <p>It's still cold but it's not freezing, which was one excuse that stopped me from getting my arse on the saddle. Only some commuting so far but it feels as though I haven't had a break. I feel it the next day of course but again not half as much as I would have expected. I'm riding quite slowly and am finding the hills quite a challenge but this is to be expected. Most other cyclists are passing me but it doesn't bother me as it may have done in the past: I'm very happy that I'm even riding at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: continue with the Carnivore diet</p>
    <p>I have essentially been continuing with the Carnivore diet. That has been much the same since last August. The only changes would be more time fasted and on some days eating only one meal. Early on I would have worried about energy and calories but I can now trust that my body can use the energy in my fat stores and that it doesn't drop. It's simple; it's easy to prepare; it affords me more spare time; it's cost effective and it requires next to no planning as I tend to eat the same things over and over again. I wrote a lengthier post all about the experiences of my first six months of following the Carnivore diet which is here <a href="https://t.co/Bk5oAWt3sf?amp=1">10 unexpected benefits of the Carnivore Diet</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Friends</h4>
    <p>I had planned to be quite systematic but even through a fairly organic process I have kept up with friends through face to face meetings, phone calls, WhatsApp messages and emails. Occasionally I feel that I should not be the one making the effort but then ask myself whether I should even consider that because the end result is still good.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: follow the Waking Up course</p>
    <p>I have been practicing every day and I have been using the Waking Up meditation app from Sam Harris. They are fairly short guided meditations lasting around 10 minutes. My goal was to become consistent rather than suddenly go back to my former practice in my 20's, when I did 2-3 hours a day. Having done little or no meditation for 20 years this is perfect. I am really enjoying it and also how it affects the rest of my day.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: follow the Practical Javascript Course</p>
    <p>This one started off quite well but then seemed to fade out. I still have ongoing debates with myself about whether I really want it and if I could or would want to spend more of my time in programming work. But the month isn't over yet and what I have done I have enjoyed. It's been review mainly but again as with meditation more about creating consistency than anything else. I did watch the Office Hours on YouTube where they discuss aspects of the course and I found that every inspiring. One person essentially summed up the whole course as being about how to ask good questions and how to read a large codebase. Those two key skills are developed as the course progresses, so that is going to be my focus.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: stick to one book, Our Mutual Friend</p>
    <p>One thing that I have found with reading a novel is that I like to read a whole chapter or not at all. I think that is why my dice roll idea (a random number of minutes) from last year didn't work. Assigning a certain number of minutes as a reading goal leaves me mid chapter. I have been sticking to one book this month: Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens and have been reading at least one chapter every morning. Sometimes I have been reading on the train & bus as well as the bath. My session in the morning is the one that I do without fail but the others are optional extras.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: wake up at 06:30 every moring using the Bedtime app</p>
    <p>In the few weeks that I have been doing this, it has probably had the most impact of all my goals. Let me explain. I read somewhere that it is more imporatant to get up at the same time each day, more so than going to bed at the same time. I decided to go for both and have been using the Bedtime app on my iPhone and set a bedtime of 23:30 and a wake time of 06:30. I do find 23:30 a little too early but 06:30 is just right. Again, the aim of this exercise is routine and consistency. What this has allowed me to do is to create a morning 'block' of practice. This 'block' comprises of Morning Pages, meditation, reading and strength training, in that order. I haven't managed the times every single day but have managed to complete the 'block'. I have had late nights at Samaritans and got up later the following day but the 'block' has become a consisent start to my day and I really look forward to it. This is largely due to my sleep routine and sets me up for the rest of the day. I'm not always sleeping well and I think that may be due to eating too late i.e. too close to bedtime: this is something that I will need to investigate. But so far a big thumbs up to Bedtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: follow the Simple &amp; Sinister routine</p>
    <p>For the month of February I have changed from the RKC program minimum which involves doing a lot of clean and press movements and pull-ups in between 'rungs' of the 'ladders' to the 'simple and sinister' routine. I did this in order to let my left shoulder recover. I think this was caused by doing weighted pull-ups and proved to be quite painful. I have missed doing pull-ups but I have really enjoyed the 'simple and sinister' routine of swings and get-ups and the fact that it is a daily practice. I have stuck with the 16kg kettle bell and have not touched the 24kg one at all. My goal is to reach the required 10 sets of 10 swings and by the middle of the month I got to 8 sets of 10, but did indeed reach ten by the end of the month. Some of these were two handed and some one handed. In the turkish get-up the requirement is 5 either side and I have reached that. Just like with the Carnivore diet, the lack of variety, doing the same thing every day has been quite refreshing and has allowed me to focus on the practice of the movements rather than trying to lift more weight. The next step once the required number of repititions have been achieved is ot increase the speed without losing good form. 5 minutes to complete 10 x 10 swings and 5 minutes to complete 5 sets of 2 get-ups. When that can be accomplished, then would be the time to tray a heavier weight.</p>

  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: just get on the mat and see what happens</p>
    <p>I have been teaching more classes this month. Only 4 classes a week in total but that is already double of what I have been doing. And there is time required to commute to and from the venue. I have been covering classes in Wimbledon. I'm not using this as an excuse but to say that even though I have not been doing much practice on my own at home, I have been doing more yoga. I have been a little disappointed with my lack of practice at home but the extra teaching does make up for it I think. At home in the evening I seem to go into a sort of leisure mode and forget all about my goals.</p>

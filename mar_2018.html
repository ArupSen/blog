<p>January and February went pretty well and I was very consistent and focused on my goals. I was looking at the list almost every day and I was writing updates twice a week. Due to being very familiar with my goals and also working on my year plan on and off throughout this time I got some good ideas about how to continue this month and kept some notes. So I'm hitting the ground running this month.</p>
<p>The year plan is 90% ready and I've spent a long time writing it but until it's fully 100% complete I don't want to implement it into my goals for March. I imagine that it will be completed within the next few days (today is 1st March) and I will be adding things (or perhaps removing) to this months plan.</p>
  <p>One thing that I have used from the year plan is the goals on pause. These are goals where I just wasn't feeling very engaged but don't want to drop completely. More details in the year plan.</p>

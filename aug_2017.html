<p>Having read through the year plan after more or less ignoring it in July I sort of feel inspired again. Sometimes I tend to avoid my list of goals as if they are imposed by some outside agency but that isn't the case, they are set by me and maintained by me and they represent what I want to do and what is important to me.</p>
<p>The Programming goal has been removed and I will also be removing the 'Coding Hour' reminders from my phone.</p>
<p>It's now getting close to the end of the month with the date at the 26th. Having said that I would leave the programming for this month and possibly for the rest of the year I have signed up to a Ruby programming course with The Pragmatic Studio. I think it was a classic case of wanting to keep something when faced with the prospect of throwing it out. It started with me looking at it and wondering if it was only a cursory interest then before I knew it I was doing the free lessons leading up to the full course. I paid my fee and then continued. A lot of it isn't new to me but as it's not for a goal or in order to advance my career I've classed it as a form of entertainment. So far it's been fun.</p>
<p>On the 16th I came down with some sort of bug. It was some sort of stomach bug but I was left so depleted that I could hardly stand and therefore had to cancel all of my appointments for the next few days. I didn't leave the house and slept for most of the next three days. On the fourth day I left the house to attend my Samaritans shift which was quite hard going.</p>
<p>One thing that I didn't do at the end of June and was thinking of doing over the past couple of months was to update and review the plan for the year. Now that it is the end of August there really isn't much point. So I'm now left with the option of reviewing the plan for the final four mounths of the year or leaving it till the end of September as it meant to be every three months.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Just continue with my regular shifts and possibly do one at Waltham Forest branch.</p>
    <p>I started the month with an overnight shift on the 1st but no others so far (it's the 10th).</p>
    <p>As I have mentioned above I did a shift immediately after being ill for a few days and it was tough going. But there were two new people so I was down in a supervisory capacity. After that shift I saw my new mentee. I have been thinking about doing shifts at another branch but that hasn't happened yet and having stepped down from other roles at the branch I feel that I have time enough now for taking on a new mentee.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with twice weekly sessions or more.</p>
    <p>This one has been going surprisingly well and shows me that I'm keen to keep it up. Initially I found that my speed and accuracy was below where I had left it previously but by the end of the month I'm back to where I had left off.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with Dickens.</p>
    <p>I finished Dombey and Son on the 5th and while I was on the tube looking for the next Dickens (which is David Copperfield) I began to read one that I already had on my Kindle which was The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford. It seems like a short one so might make a nice change from the longer Dickens novel. Think that David Copperfield is a long one and that means probably the rest of the year will be taken up reading that one.</p>
    <p>Really enjoying the Good Soldier. It is written in a kind of monologue style; very conversational and has the flavour of Tender is the Night.</p>
    <p>I seem to be reading on the tube as I haven't been riding my bike very much as well as reading at home. Aside from reading I've also been listening to audio books. I received a few from a friend and so far I have listened to The Magic of Reality by Richard Dawkins and Nomad by Ayaan Hirsi Ali.</p>
    <p>I've now finished The Good Soldier and have added David Copperfield on to my Kindle.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Focus on what to eat rather than what to avoid i.e. more fibre, veg, oily fish.</p>
    <p>I had pizza, beer and also chips. Lots of chocolate too. Oh and biscuits. So yeah, all very healthy.</p>
    <p>As the month has progressed I have been watching many YouTube videos about diet and what to eat and what not to eat. Even though I know that it would be futile and short lived to attempt any form of healthy eating regime, I did enjoy very much thinking about implementing these ideas. I've been trying to convince a friend to take up the 5:2 fasting diet. He sees that it would be beneficial but does not believe that he could keep it up. I've researched other forms of intermittent fasting and found a recent trend to follow a protocol known as 16:8. These refer to hours rather than days. Instead of fasting for two out of the seven days of the week the idea was to fast every day and inside of a 24 hour period 16 of those hours were fasting and 8 were eating. It was referred to as a fasting window and feeding window. Due to the feeding window being so short and having to consume the required calories inside an 8 hour period it was also called a feasting window. My friend thought that this would be something that he could actually maintain and considered that it was more within his reach than the 5:2 protocol. I want to lose bodyfat myself and so am considering that I add it to my current 5:2 regime.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work toward 12 reps in pull-up and dips. Daily handstand practice.</p>
    <p>My attempts at increasing my reps all got sidelined due to being ill even though I started the month strong and over the first two weeks. I've only just started again in the last week of the month first doing only one set per exercise and then two in the second workout. I don't want to push it and get ill again or have a relapse but I also don't want to neglect my training: it's a fine balance.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Commute 2-3 times a week. Possibly do a longer ride.</p>
    <p>So far it's been only a once a week commute.</p>
    <p>I booked an Audax ride for the 19th which was a Saturday and during the week leading up to that ride I got ill. I even wondered if it was psychosomatic; it seems clear that I don't want to ride. I didn't ride again for the rest of the month.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Put something on eBay on Sundays. Focus on larger items.</p>
    <p>Immediately after moving house I was keen to sell things on eBay and generally clear out the things that I would no longer be using but I am starting to settle and not care about all the things that I have but don't need. These items came sharply into focus during and shortly after the move but it seems that period has now passed. All of my possessions have been neatly stowed away and my worries and concerns are elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Add splits, handstands and backbends into routine.</p>
    <p>It's been very short sessions and many days where didn't even do yoga at all. I tend to go through the motions and practice postures that usually come to mind, more out of habit rather than having any sort of plan. Doing splits or handstands didn't come to mind and I didn't practice. Being ill also gave me the excuse for skipping sessions even when I was feeling better.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Think about a proper day off each week as this month I won't be seeing Maya. Research beach holiday. Eat out, could even be Wagamama on my own as I used to do for my thousand mile meal. Buy one item of clothing. Read up on creating a will.</p>
    <p>I did have a lot of time off. Enforced for a short period by my illness and also quiet times as a result of my housemate being away. I also enjoyed the August bank holiday weekend with no appointments other than one Samaritans shift. Other than take aways from the local chippy I haven't eaten out as such. One item of clothing that I really need is a new pair of jeans as my current ones have holes both in the left pocket and near the crotch. Researching holidays and wills isn't something that I've done.</p>

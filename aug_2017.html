<p>Having read through the year plan after more or less ignoring it in July I sort of feel inspired again. Sometimes I tend to avoid my list of goals as if they are imposed by some outside agency but that isn't the case, they are set by me and maintained by me and they represent what I want to do and what is important to me.</p>
<p>The Programming goal has been removed and I will also be removing the 'Coding Hour' reminders from my phone.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Just continue with my regular shifts and possibly do one at Waltham Forest branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with twice weekly sessions or more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with Dickens.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Focus on what to eat rather than what to avoid i.e. more fibre, veg, oily fish.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work toward 12 reps in pull-up and dips. Daily handstand practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Commute 2-3 times a week. Possibly do a longer ride.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Put something on eBay on Sundays. Focus on larger items.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Add splits, handstands and backbends into routine.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Think about a proper day off each week as this month I won't be seeing Maya. Research beach holiday. Eat out, could even be Wagamama on my own as I used to do for my thousand mile meal. Buy one item of clothing. Read up on creating a will.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

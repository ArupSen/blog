<p>This month the main focus has to be finding a job of some description. Also as I'm bringing my wheel building workshop back home to SE London so it will be making those adjustments to my living space.</p>
<p>It's been a difficult month with a great lack of work which left me rather despondent to say the least. It's also been very hot weather wise so I took the opportunity to just go to the park and read as well as spending time with friends having long conversations about what has been happening and how I might deal with it. I had hoped to write a more ongoing account of my progress through the month but with bigger and more pressing issues such as finding more work and possibly giving up my home, my goals sort of took a back seat. Looking back now though as it's the 27th, I can see that I did maintain many of them just as part of my routine. Routine and habit are so important when things seem to be falling apart that I think it really helped me to get through it. I think that in a way it gave me the strength to face my feelings of being overwhelmed rather than being purely practical. This would be a post in itself which I may or may not write but for the time being I will stick to my goals.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Put toaster on eBay. Sell books.</p>
    <p>I started polishing the toaster but realised that it would take a long time and put it to one side to continue at a later date. You can guess what happened next. It got completely sidelined and even though I left it in the sitting room as a constant reminder, I learned how to ignore it. I'm about to go on holiday next week and think that it would be a shame to leave it uncompleted before I go. I also had guests earlier this week and thought that I would try and complete it before then but didn't. Strangely, no one made any comments about it.</p>
    <p>I did put a few books on eBay but after watching some videos on YouTube about minimalism, I took quite a few other books that I had kept for reference to a local charity shop. I have also rediscovered Free Cycle. I have created an account and even though I haven't used it yet plan to use it to discard larger items and items that are too valuable to simply put in the bin but have no real resale value. I've sold a few Xbox games and have also taken some items to my branch of Samaritans. Now that my diet has changed I also threw out food items that are high in carbohydrates.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Carry on as I am and report any major fluctuations. Possibly cheat if social, try new recipes.</p>
    <p>This diet or way of eating is starting to feel like the way that I've eaten for many years rather than 4-5 months. I feel very happy and comfortable with it. I have been researching how to take it to the next step though, that being the carnivore diet which is essentially eating only foods from the animal kingdom. I am very intrigued and attracted to this idea and what I've researched is people moving from a low carb high fat diet to a ketogenic one and then moving on to a carnivore diet. The evidence is all anecdotal but they all claim improvements with each change. My own plan is to give it a try and to that end I have been tapering towards it. I have been cutting down on vegetables and nuts in my diet for 2-3 weeks, including the time that I'm away will comprise of meat, fish, eggs and cheese. I was eating pork shoulder steaks with a large pile of broccoli as a regular evening meal but that has now changed to only the steaks with the broccoli swapped for cheese. One thing that I need to bear in mind is that with no veggies I just need to eat a bit more. Due to the high fat content the hunger is diminished and so I can end up eating too little.</p>
    <p>Overall I have found the whole thing very satisfying. Having a long fasted period during the earlier part of the day coincides with when I want to get things done and in the later part of the day when I just want to relax I can enjoy a meat feast. I can already feel that my digestion has improved even after a week or so with reduced vegetable matter. I was trying to figure out whether it was the change from fasting to feasting was the reason I suddenly had the runs but I'm still doing the same but without any veggies or nuts: my stomach and digestive system seems to feel a lot better without them.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work daily on PJS, wheel worksheet and wheel mobile site. Daily small amount vs occasional large amount.</p>
    <p>Having developed such great motivation and enthusiasm to program again, this month I felt that it was the very last thing that I wanted to do. Even though I felt this way I still had this idea that I would pursue the course at some point, improve my skills to build and maintain software and secure freelance work but I have to ask myself when that 'some point' will be. I do other things regularly such as yoga, strength training and morning pages; until programming finds a similar slot in my life, I'm not really going to improve.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Set daily minutes using dice roll. Set a reading day and follow through.</p>
    <p>Except for a few days when I didn't read at all I have been fairly consistent with my reading. On some days I did roll the dice and on others didn't. Been really enjoying Little Dorrit and to help me unplug from technology I have been considering reading a real paper book as my next book. I don't actually remember if I did have a reading day or not but there were days when I took my Kindle to the park and spent a good amount of time reading.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work up to 3 x 3 clean and press ladders.</p>
    <p>I have made noticeable progress this month. With the clean and press move my clean technique has become smoother with minimal banging on the back of the wrist. Firstly, I had to lift the kettle bell with both hands as well as a jerk to achieve the overhead lockout position. Then I was able to do that with one arm only and then with minimal or no jerk. On one occasion I was even able to achieve 3 x 3 ladders. Mostly it seems to be 3, 2, 2. In the book he (Pavel) talks about varying the intensity and suggests an easy day, medium day and hard day, so I've been just varying the volume of the session based on how I have felt that day. I don't know if it has been due to the heat or due to the changes in my diet but I have felt tired, dizzy and weak on some mornings but still did my session. On some days I really felt like missing it but that could be also because the novelty is wearing off now. But it's early days: I am still working towards a smooth 3 x 3 and once I can do that then a 5 x 5, which could be weeks or even months, probably the latter but as long as there is tangible progress it doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>As well as the clean and press my handstands have been slowly improving even though sometimes it feels as though there is no progress at all. My swings are improving as well as my get ups. I don't really need to change much but perhaps just dip into the book again to re-invigorate myself and feel assured that I'm on the right track.</p>
    <p>Going away for a few days I will miss my training but as I've been doing it for a good while now, I think that having a short break might be beneficial rather than harmful.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: Go for 30k+ steps one day.</p>
    <p>I did look at my Pedometer app a few times but only to see if I had completed 10k steps but didn't actively go out to try and walk that amount. The idea of walking 30k+ steps did cross my mind a couple of times as I had my goals copied in my Evernote but it didn't motivate me to pursue it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep doing the splits every day and use the dice to randomise duration of holding the pose. Do the corpse.</p>
    <p>This month I was watching a lot of a series called Stargate SG-1. The episodes are just over 40 minutes long and so when I did practice, which sadly wasn't every day, it lasted for just over 40 minutes while I watched an episode. When I did practice I did feel a lot better and generally calmer but that wasn't motivation enough for me to actually do it. I think I did the corpse only once at home. I also covered a class for a friend. This is something that I haven't done for a long time and it was refreshing to teach at a new venue with new people.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Get a regular part-time job. Finish year plan for 2nd half of the year. Celebrate Maya's half birthday. Complete mobile wheel site. Get home workshop set up.</p>
    <p>Part-time job? No. Year plan, almost. Maya's half birthday, yes. Wheel mobile site, no. Wheel building workshop is now set up in my bedroom though. Took about half a day but it's really nice to have it home again. It's very quiet and bright there, two things that were missing at the shop. Also no commuting!.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Paused goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Cycling, Guitar, Meditation, Samaritans, Sleep, Typing</p>
    <p>Throughout the whole month I cycled perhaps twice but then the goal is on pause. One thing that did occur to me was that soon my free travel on TFL services is about to expire and rather than paying for the privilige I think that it would be far better both for my fitness and my pocket to get back on my bike. One thing that I miss about Audax is that it takes me away for a day; a mini holiday. That is something that has been missing.</p>
    <p>I took the guitar down from its hook on the wall and played it a few times. I found it comforting when I was feeling low, literally playing the blues you could say. I was on the point of selling it but after those two sessions I have changed my mind. I have started re-growing the fingernails on my right hand so that I am ready to play whenever the mood arises.</p>
    <p>I've been missing Samaritans. I even went into the branch a couple of times with the pretext of using the shredder and dropping off items for the car boot sale. It was nice to bump into people and have a brief exchange. I miss the volunteers, I miss the callers and I miss the branch itself. At one point I thought about signing into a shift but didn't in the end. I've taken the time off for a reason and even though I feel that I dealt with that I don't know if I am fully ready to get back to supporting callers and giving them my full attention without being preoccupied.</p>
      <p>Due to the hot weather I haven't been sleeping that well. I've been going to bed later and getting up earlier and generally feeling tired but I don't care too much as I seem to have enough energy to get through the day and do the things that I need to get done. One thing that I have noticed is that I have been dozing quite heavily on buses and buses and trains. Another reason not to use public transport: aside from night rides I don't generally doze off when I'm riding my bike.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Friends</h4>
    <p>I'm adding this one at the end even though it's not a goal as such but one that I have added to the year plan. During July I spent a lot of time with friends both face to face, on the phone and via messages. I needed them. But having re-connected with them I don't want to drop them that now that I feel that I got the support that I needed. I need my friends and I need a social life in spite of the need to spend a good deal of time on my own. This section really is just to say how much I have appreciated the time that I have spent with those people and how much it has helped to move me forward through a very difficult time in my life.</p>

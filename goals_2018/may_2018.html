<p>The blog was completely neglected during May so I'm looking back from June and piecing together what I did and did not do. It'll obviously be sketchy and devoid of detail but I thought I'd do it anyway just as a kind of review and a sense of continuity. I haven't listed any goals as I don't remember setting any specific ones for the month.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Got rid of my deck chair. As I no longer have a garden I gave it to a friend who does.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>I enthusiastically continued with my diet plan without interruption. I lost some weight and I wrote about the plan as a separate blog post. I really don't mind eating the same things over and over again which makes this eating plan very easy to follow.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Not sure how I stumbled across it but I'm extremely glad that I did. While I was working on Free Code Camp and also working on an app to calculate my keto macronutrient ratios I was searching for how to think like a programmer. It was a course by Gordon Zhu called Practical Javascript and the name rang a bell because I have encountered him in the past. The course involved creating a TODO list app with the premise that everything is essentially a to do list and by learning how to create one it enables you to look at how to create any other web application. It got me inspired about programming again and about programming for its own sake rather than as a means to get a job. I do need more money and could possibly use my skills to get more work but I don't want to study with that goal in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>I continued with Little Dorrit and of course with Enter the Kettlebell. I also read some of Free Will by Sam Harris. I was also planning to read the book about money by Tony Robbins but I really didn't get on with his style of writing so after many attempts I gave up.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I've been gradually adding the kettlebell clean to my sessions as well as the press. I feel fewer aches and pains following the get up and have got myself a pair of dice to set the time for swing part of my workout. Other than that I'm keeping it all fairly consistent and am noticitng that I am gradually getting stronger and steadier. I'm still following the routine from Enter The Kettlebell book and don't mind how long it takes me to work through the whole program.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>I kept it up but stopped using the timer and doing the corpse at the end. It has lapsed back to the old days where I do a nominal amount while watching an episode of a TV series. Doing it this way seems less focused and somehow I find it disappointing compared to when I do it as a thing in itself but I have been doing the splits on a regular basis which is good.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>I don't remember.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Paused goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Cycling, Guitar, Meditation, Samaritans, Sleep, Typing, Walking</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here I am starting October on the 13th (Friday the 13th no less) having more or less missed September altogether. As well as setting my goals for this month following my original intention at the start of the year of reviewing and updating that plan I'm also looking at the final quarter of 2017 and wondering how to spend it.</p>
<p>It's now the 3rd of November and time to get this report out and after writing the paragraph above I only set one goal for the month, which was to get to bed my midnight. Having not really set any goals for the month as such I will just have to refer to ones that I was carrying in my head and sort of proposed to put them on the list for October and also refer to the goals of the year.</p>
<p>The other thing that I had planned from the start of the year was to review the entire plan for the year and perhaps amend it as necessary and have a plan for the final three months. This didn't happen. I did think about it a lot but that was as far as it got.</p>

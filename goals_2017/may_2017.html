<p>We start on the 8th of May and with no goals set. Why? Because I'm having to suddenly move house. It's a possiblity that became real; something that was remote into an immediate and urgent undertaking. I don't really wish to make the details of this sudden move public (I know hardly anyone reads this blog but still) but I can still relate how it is making me feel and how that effects my goals. I seem to oscillating between panic and denial. When I'm panicking I need to take action in form of packing boxes or browsing for my new ISP. When I'm in denial I just want to separate myself from everything and the way I seem to do that is either to watch TV series or play video games. Random browsing on the internet also works. But either state doesn't really allow me to engage with my goals. What will get me through this month will be my habits. Nearly all of my goals are long-term ongoing ones and even though I'm not setting any specific goals for this month I do have them for the year and the regularity of the previous years will see me through: I do it not because it's listed as a goal but because it's just what I do. At 1.00pm on a Monday, Wednesday or Friday I do my strength training routine. I simply look at the clock and find myself making a start. I don't need to go through it in my mind and wonder if I should or if it's a good idea etc., I just get on with it.</p>
<p>As I've now started to write the report and seeing the word 'Goals', I'm wondering whether or not to set a very easily achievable goal and one that would be a realistic one during this month of upheaval. Perhaps during a period of a big change such as this, having something ongoing and constant may be quite a good thing in that sense.</p>

<p>Looking back over 2017 as I write this 2 weeks into December, all I can remember, especially as I have a cold right now, which has lasted a week, is that much of the year has been characterised by illness. Sometimes lasting a week, sometimes lasting longer and putting a damper on my efforts to work at anything due to lack of energy, motivation and in great need of rest. Once the illness had passed I didn't quite snap back to my so-called normal mode but was much slower paced by the time I did get back to what I would consider normal, then lo and behold, I was sick again. I would have to refer to my monthly reports to get a more accurate picture of how many times I got sick and for how long each time but as a guess I would say at least 6 times and for about a week each time. That makes 42 days of being sick. As I have explained that doesn't necessarily mean 323 days of striving at maximum speed. Along with physical illness comes an emotional counterpart which gave rise to low mood, lack of motivation and a general sense of meaninglessness. Add to this an enforced house move following letters of eviction along with a long lapse from a regular yoga student both of which caused a great deal of anxiety. That was in May and it took a good while to settle and to absorb the impact of that event. That gives a general backdrop to the year.</p>
<p>I think that if I go through the year plan and comment on it looking back I can address everything blow by blow and then add concluding comments.</p>
<p>As well as the time spent being sick and getting well, I spent a lot of time watching TV series and playing video games. Not a bad thing in and of itself but I do feel that I did it to the detriment of other things that I also wanted to do. I didn't sit down at the start of the year and plan to watch seven seasons of The Walking Dead for example (that is only one among many) but one by one I watched 100 episodes. Even though there was no formal declaration to do this, I still wanted it and took steps to achieve it. But it didn't really involve much of a challenge other than sitting on the sofa and keeping my eyes on the screen. Which begs the question then as to what exactly is a goal? Does it need to be declared or can it be passive? Is it the same as a challenge, a quest, a target, an aim etc. Perhaps a discussion for a post in itself.</p>
<p>First of all the guiding principles. Obviously they are not goals in themselves but I want to look back and see how well I used them as such and whether they did indeed guide me.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at my 3-4 monthly appraisal: that happened only once in April. Rather than a means to see how I was getting on I saw it as another thing that I needed to do and thus avoided it. It was a great opportunity that would have been useful to really hone my goals and align them with my aspirations at that time but instead I went back to my old way of thinking which was to think of the plan as some sort of oppressive regime set by some sort of outside agency. This was of course something that I was expressly trying to avoid and create goals for myself that I genuinely wanted to achieve. All of the other guiding principles were about taking things slowly and getting more into the idea of long term discipline rather than being short term target driven. Somehow I didn't take any of this on board at least to the extent I would have liked.</p>
<p>Goals, in the order that they appear in the year plan for 2017.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>At the start of the year I realised that was doing a bit too much: taking calls during my regular scheduled duties, mentoring and being part of the leadership team. Over the course of the first couple of months I finished mentoring with that mentee, stepped down from the leadership team and only did my regular listening duties. Even though I had been enjoying these extra roles at first it got to the point where I was finding that I was considering quitting my involvement altogether. I thought about this and talked it through with my colleagues and tried to remember why I had initially got involved: to support callers. Taking away all of the extraneous roles allowed me to re-establish my connection with the main purpose of the organisation and re-invigorate my purpose.</p>
    <p>Later on during the year I did take on another mentee but having had a good break following the one previous to that one. I was also responsible for the branch website even though I was no longer part of the publicity team but as there was nobody else with my skills I trained someone else who was willing to take it on and yet another responsibility was handed on. At first it did feel as though I had turned my back on it but seeing the updates and seeing that they were more than capable of managing without me gave me the confidence to let it go.</p>
    <p>One final change that I made towards the end of the year (even though the idea started just after summer) was to update my rota and free up my Tuesdays. Most of my duties were on a Tuesday and this had been fine up till early summer when I moved house and also moved the base of my wheel building operations to Racer Rosa in Walthamstow. Prior to that I was free to work on my wheels at home where I had my workshop but now that was at the other side of London I had to schedule my work so that I could maximise the time that I spent there. I had a chat with the Waltham Forest branch which is only 15 minutes walk from the shop and they agreed to allow me to do ad hoc shifts and fill gaps when I could. I still kept one Tuesday daytime shift at Croydon as there aren't many that are free at that time but in general I now had both Tuesday and Wednesday free to work at the shop and possibly do a shift at the Waltham Forest branch on one of those days too.</p>
    <p>In the final couple of months of the year it was time to conduct peer reviews which was a real privilege as it allowed you to listen in on calls that were answered by a colleague. This process once again took me back to the real reason I was involved with Samaritans and why the service is so important to so many people. I really would like to remain involved for a good long while rather than have an intense burst of activity and then quit. I think that pacing myself would be the best way to do this.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>For the early part of the year I was really enjoying my practice and made it more like a workout using sets and reps. I seemed to get stuck at 60 wpm and then couldn't move beyond it. In some ways it didn't seem to bother me because I was improving very slowly and certainly maintaining my speed and accuracy but toward the end of the year I was wondering why I was not progressing beyond that level. I thought perhaps I needed to challenge myself and that maybe I had settled at a speed that seemed adequate for my needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>At the start of the year I seemed to be enjoying Git and the command line and very much enjoyed my first contribution to a project on Github. I was already starting to get a bit concerned that my interest in programming could be conflicted with a desire to make it into a career move but I needn't have worried as my interest gradually diminished and the year went on to a point where I wasn't really doing it at all. I was thinking about doing a Data Structures and Algorithms course but then was also wondering whether I should even drop Programming as a goal from my year plan.</p>
    <p>Later in the year I was thinking about Rails (something that I've been trying to learn on and off since 2008) and started to follow the rails tutorial website / book. After spending only a few short weeks on this and setting reminders to get myself to keep going with it, Programming of any sort was pushed to the side and left there till the end of the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>At the start of the year I thought that I was reading Dickens as I was for most of the year but looking back at my reports I can see that at the start of the year I was reading Tender is the Night and Reasons to Stay Alive. The following month it was Shoot the Damn Dog in parallel with Martin Chuzzlewit and it seems from what I wrote that I was reading a lot and enjoying it very much. This continued till August when I read The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford and also listened to some audio books after which I got back into Dickens. Towards the end of the year I continued in this way and in December I read the Dickens novella, A Christmas Carol.</p>
    <p>Looking back it seems that I've done rather well with my reading goals in 2017 both in terms of making progress through my reading list and also being engaged with what I've been reading. Sometimes, quite often actually, I felt that I should be reading more than I was or that I should be reading a lot more but I seem to feel that with most of my goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>First off I kept up my main regime which is the 5:2 fasting diet which is now so normal. By the end of the year it was more than 3 years since I originally started it. The idea of having a period where I would be eating a diet that was based around eggs didn't really happen. Each month when I would read the year plan and see it there I thought about trying it but put it off by another month. As for creatine, I didn't even go as far as researching how much it would cost or how one would implement it into the diet.</p>
    <p>Aside from the goal of continuing with the 5:2 diet I also had a goal of making one day a week a healthy eating day when I would avoid pre-packed and processed foods as well as keeping sugar, fat and salt as low as possible. This actually happened once or twice but then I got ill and found that I needed junk food to cheer me up. In March I managed to eat 4 healthy eating days but it was a tough act to follow.</p>
    <p>I did manage to follow it and as well as the healthy eating day I also was thinking about my Omega-3 intake and as such was eating salmon, sardines and mackerel.</p>
    <p>Still, all of it stopped when I moved house as I felt that I needed an amount of junk food as comfort food. The idea of the healthy eating day was completely forgotten and junk food ruled the roost.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>The mainspring of my strength training goal for 2017 was the book Overcoming Gravity. It's a veritable tome packed with everything you could possibly want to know about bodyweight training and gymnastics. All the most up to date research on which exercises to do and how to best construct your routine. This arrived in March and it inspired me a great deal. It allowed me to focus rather than keep re-evaluating my routine and looking at routines that others were using and wondering if I should change.</p>
    <p>Many lapses were made due to illness and following the house move there was also a bit of a break from training. When I got it going again due to working at the shop on Wednesdays I was only training twice a week which made it more imperative to keep to my sessions. I kept setting goals to re-introduce the 'greasing the groove' technique and also to work on handstands every day but didn't actually implement it again in 2017.</p>
    <p>Following the home move I seemed to be more in maintenance mode with my strength training rather than trying to make any progress especially as I kept getting ill and needed to relax and recover. One thing that I did discover when I dipped into the book again in the summer was the importance of adequate rest periods. I found that I was able to push much harder during a set if I took around 3 minutes between them. This of course made the session much longer lasting almost 2 hours. In the initial stages I was happy to spend the extra time but soon compromised with alternating sets of opposing exercises and reducing the rest time to 2 minutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>I cycled so little in 2017 that if you compared it to 2016 then you would be astounded at the difference. There were periods of up to six weeks where I didn't even mount my bicycle. One major reason for this was the recurring bouts of illness which sapped enough strength and energy to prevent me from riding my bike. But following these periods when my fitness had started to return I was left with doubt, anxiety, fear and even a slight amount of aversion to riding my bike.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter Clearing</h4>
    <p>For the first couple of months this seemed to be going well after which I was at a loss as to what I should throw out. The goal that I had set was to either chuck something or to organise something and in my reports I was commenting on how I was neglecting the organising option.</p>
    <p>Following my house move there was a bit of clutter clearing activity, especially eBay. My reports say that I sold a lot on eBay during the month of July but by August I had organised and stowed away most of my unwanted items so that they were out of view and my burning need to expunge them was gone. Shame really. There was a bit more clutter clearing activity in November but that was about the size of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>The ongoing dilemma of how to make progress when all I really seem to want is maintenance. My default seems to be doing some random stretches while watching something on the screen such as YouTube videos or a TV series. I make plans to work on certain postures and in 2017 there were only a few that I wanted to develop such as the splits, the upside down bow backbend and the handstand (being also developed in strength training) along with breathing exercises and using a timer to make sure that I remain in the postures for the required duration and even though this all does seem to work for my strength training, it doesn't work at all during yoga. How is it that I am able to focus so totally during my strength training but not during my yoga session? My theory is that somewhere along the line I got into the habit of making it an intuitive practice and being distracted by watching or listening to something was allowed. I tried and I tried to stop myself from doing this and to be more focused but it just wouldn't happen. Every now and again it would happen and I would get excited that I would then be able to continue in that vain but as soon as the next session came around, the TV was on again.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Since moving into the Adamsrill Road flat in mid-2010 I had been sleeping very little. I'm a bit of a night owl and enjoy staying up late. But even though I was going to bed late I was still getting up early. For example, my regular bedtime would be something like 01:30 and then I would be up and about by 07:30. This became my routine. Sometimes I would sleep a little more and sometimes a little less. I knew that sleep was important and was sure that I probably needed more than I was getting but I disregarded it thinking of myself as a creative person who needed that extra time to work on the various projects that I had on the go. A lot of the time though I didn't really have anything on the go except for gaming or TV series.</p>
    <p>When the importance of sleep was mentioned in the Overcoming Gravity book it made an impression on me. It felt as though I was pouring my training into a bucket that had a hole and that sleep would fill that hole. Being ill a lot of the time as I have mentioned many times already, meant that I felt weak and tired so it made it easy to go to bed early and even sleep during the day.</p>
    <p>It doesn't appear as a goal until September and even then I find it hard to get to bed early in order to get more sleep. But at least the intention was there and the realisation of its importance.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>I managed very few of my one-off goals. I think that this may be due to setting them at the start of the year and then not really reviewing them as such and simply carrying them over rather than really considering them. I suppose I treated them as my 'someday / maybe' list of things to do rather than aims that have a timeline.</p>
    <p>I'll go through each of them very briefly in the same paragraph rather than listing out each item separately. These are again as they appear in year plan 2017. The beach holiday was something that I didn't really want to do on my own when it came down to it. I kept telling myself that it was too expensive but there are plenty of package holidays which I could have easily afforded. But having met people on those holidays who were alone I just didn't like the idea of being that person. The summer was pretty good so that made up for it but it's not the same as being away.</p>
    <p>I did buy new clothes but not quite as many as I had in mind. One notable purchase was for my birthday which was a winter jacket. This made a massive difference to my experience of winter: I hardly felt the cold, which is something that I complain about each year but do very little about it. I did throw out worn out clothes in a bid to encourage me to buy new ones to replace them but that didn't really happen either.</p>
    <p>Towards the end of 2016 I was doing a good amount of cooking, especially curries using recipes from Madhur Jaffrey and other popular chefs, exchanging recipes with friends. But moving into 2017 this gradually dwindled away and having moved out and finding that the new home didn't have a gas hob it took me a while to re-establish my culinary art. Fast food and junk food were the order of the day but it would have been good to have interspersed it with some more home cooked meals.</p>
    <p>Teeth? Nope. There was pain, a good deal of pain but I had painkillers and more pieces of tooth were lost and even a filling came out but it wasn't enough to take me to the dentist to get my teeth done. I really would like to carry this over but it has to move to 'someday / maybe' rather than an actual goal within a time frame.</p>
    <p>I did visit friends out of town both in the UK and abroad. It was good to see them after such a long lapse. Out of sight out of mind as they say and it's all too easy to keep putting this off because it requires blocking out a certain amount of time such as a full day or a weekend but how many days did spend just watching TV series when I could have done something like this instead (and watched TV with the friend even).</p>
    <p>I don't remember even considering a yoga or meditation retreat at any time other than when I first wrote it down at he start of the year and now that it is the start of the next year I know how eager I can feel about adding things to the list thinking that I've got a whole year ahead of me.</p>
    <p>I did think about earning more money but that was only thinking. The fact was that I earned less money. Firstly, one of my regular yoga students took about 6 months off due to injury, there were the increased costs of moving home, losses incurred at the bike shop and almost no website work at all. My response to this was to mope and dig deeper into my savings rather than try to find more work. I was approached by a previous yoga student around summer time to start up a class but then suggested that I start a public class and hire a hall to do so. Having incurred so many losses I was too frightened to take such a risk and decided to let that one go. At one point, which lasted for a couple of weeks, I got to thinking that I should have a career, one that would lead to a full time job, purely for the sake of money. Some skill that wouldn't be too difficult to learn but would lead to a high income. I thought about accountancy. The feeling didn't last though: I like my lifestyle too much and value it too highly to sacrifice it for something such as that. A little bit more of what I do already is the way forward. And that is what I will be carrying forward into 2018.</p>
    <p>It's rare for me to have a day off, meaning a proper day off where I do no work, day to day tasks or maintenance activities. When I was riding my bike a bit more and riding Audax, that was kind of a day off but really it was just a day of doing one thing. A day off in my book is a day like my birthday where anything goes. I indulge in pleasant activities without impunity and hold the world at arms length. I just have too many things on the go to be able to have a proper day off every week but it is a nice idea.</p>
    <p>I read that in the UK if you don't have a will and die 'intestate' then according to the current law your 'estate' will go directly to your children. I would be leaving my effects to my daughter anyway so perhaps I don't need one but then what if the law changes? Might be worth getting one anyway. I've had this as an idea for quite a few years now and finally decided to put it on the list but the year expired and nothing happened.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In closing it has been quite a painstaking exercise to go through each monthly report and compare what I've written with the goal for that month and for the year. Some months I haven't written anything at all except an opening paragraph. I can look at the month prior to and following that particular one to get some idea but it has shown me how important it is to maintain my monthly reports however minimal they might be.</p>

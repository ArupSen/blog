<p>From July 2010 to May 2017 I lived at Adamsrill Road in Sydenham, SE London and operated "Wheelbuilding with Arup" from there. People would either drop off their hubs and rims to me there or have them delivered to me there. I had my front room set up as my workshop with the workbench positioned along the window. There was ample space to store wheels and for clients to bring in their bikes if they wanted a while-u-wait service. There was a curious "double snowflake" laced wheel in the window which made it easy to find. As well and building and rebuilding wheels I also ran wheel building classes and workshops. It allowed me to work from home without having to pay for separate premises and to be very flexible with my working hours. It allowed clients to pick up and drop off very early or late as their schedule required. Clients seemed genuinely impressed by my home workshop set up and wished that they could have a similar one at their home. They knew that their wheels were in safe hands.</p>
<p>All that changed in 2017 when I received an eviction notice from the local county court. Prior to this there was a warning letter from the law firm who were taking my landlords to court with a view to repossession. I contacted my landlord immediately to ask for further details but he gave no information about the case but tried to reassure me that he would 'sort it' and the flat would not be repossessed and that I would not be evicted. (I also had a lodger who would consequently risk eviction too.) But I was not reassured however, especially when a second letter arrived from the same law firm stating that they had obtained a repossession notice and were now applying for the eviction notice. Once again my landlord tried to reassure me by saying that he would 'sort it' and that I shouldn't worry about eviction. When I pressed him for details he would disclose nothing whatever and fudged the issue by saying that he had a lot on his plate and other similar comments without revealing any particular details about what was going on. My rent was due at this time and some friends suggested that I withhold payment in lieu of lack of information. Being the honest soul that I am, I made the payment on time but in hindsight regret doing so as I know now that it was already too late and that eviction was imminent and if my landlord wasn't able to pay his mortgage then he certainly wouldn't be giving my deposit back.</p>
  <p>In the first week of May the eviction notice arrived and there was no longer any ambiguity over what was about to occur and no chance that my landlord would be able to 'sort it'. The best option would be to leave the flat and find a new one and after some discussion with my lodge we decided to move together rather than go our separate ways. My new housemate would be willing to split all costs 50/50 as long as I didn't operate my wheel building business from our new home. I thought about this and considered how it would affect me and thought it would be a good way to cut costs and to separate my home and work life. But where then would I build my wheels?</p>
  <p>As well as building wheels for my own clients, from 2010 I had also been building wheels for Racer Rosa bicycles. First they were based in Hatherly Mews in Walthamstow, then in Much Hadham in Hertfordshire and in late 2016 again in Walthamstow but this time at their high street store on the Central Parade. It's very close to Walthamstow Central station giving easy access.</p>
  <p>What will this mean for my clients that are closer to my previous base in Sydenham? Out of my four truing stands I kept one in Sydenham, so for small truing jobs and quick fixes I will still be able to work on them in Sydenham. But the main function of my home in Sydenham will be to act as a pick up / drop off point. I have all of my original toolset from when I first started building wheels back in 2004, so in theory I could build wheels. But as I have mentioned already, there really isn't the space here to store wheels and parts and additionally I have grown accustomed to my more precise tools, which means I will be taking the parts that have been dropped off to Walthamstow, building them there and then bringing them back when ready. When people want to have parts delivered directly to me, then Walthamstow would be the better option as I would be more likely to receive them there and less likely to miss deliveries. In Sydenham I am no longer able to receive clients along with their bikes and (as I used to) take the wheel off the bike, true it and send them on their way again. But I am still here and available albeit to a slightly lesser degree to all my previous clients.</p>
  <p>So that is why I moved and why it was so sudden. My workshop and tools are now all at Racer Rosa in Walthamstow where the next chapter of "Wheelbuilding with Arup" will unfold.</p>

<p>It's the 2nd of January 2018 and I haven't yet formulated a year plan. But I'm not going to let that stop me from starting to work on my goals. I have a fairly clear idea of what I want so here goes.</p>
<p>So far so good with week one. I feel very enthused about it all but still need to write out the year plan properly and also to complete the 2017 review.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sell one item on eBay. Discard one item from each room.</p>
    <p>I've put 2 items on eBay and threw out a load of paperwork which felt really good.</p>
    <p>During the first week of January I have been thinking about getting a bigger screen. I got quite obsessive about it and have also considered a projector. But when I sat down to think about what was prompting it all I realised that it was all about removing clutter. What I want is to remove my desk and office chair and use the computer from my sofa as I do with gaming and watching movies. Obviously when you have a new idea and get obsessive about it you want to it immediately. But I've fallen into that trap all too often. I don't want to be a buzzkill but I want to see if it's a one night stand or something more serious. Getting rid of my desk and chair would be a big change because I tend to do all of my computer related work with that set up. I used to also use my laptop and that would still be an option but to use my main computer I would have to use it without a desk with the keyboard in my lap. So I'm going to give it a couple of weeks, say till the 20th and then see if I still like the idea.</p>

  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Ride at least once each week.</p>
    <p>Rode around the block a few times for about 20 minutes. Kind of exciting but alien at the same time.</p>
    <p>I commuted today (4th). First time in about 6 weeks or so. Felt good, really good. Like part of me was missing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Skip breakfast. 16:8. Zinc gluconate.</p>
    <p>I've ordered some Zinc gluconate tablets so am just waiting for them to arrive then we'll see how it goes.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Guitar</h4>
    <p>Goals: Play on Sunday evenings 7th and 14th.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sit for 10 minutes before bed 3 times per week.</p>
    <p>I'd this on Monday and Tuesday and it really felt good.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work on Rails Tutorial once a week at library.</p>
    <p>I got up early and set up my laptop ready for the library but spent the time working on my goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with Bleak House, use one paragraph.</p>
    <p>It's nice to read before going to bed instead of watching but not sure how long I can keep this up.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do one shift at Waltham Forest.</p>
    <p>I had a look on the Waltham Forest rota but couldn't find any shifts I could sign into. They seem to have a lot more volunteers than before.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Lights out by 00:30. Read rather than watch before bed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Rebuild routine following Dec 2017 lapse.</p>
    <p>Did a short one set routine on Monday which felt tough but manageable.</p>
    <p>A follow up routine on Friday again doing only one set of each exercise to gently ease myself in. Felt a lot easier than on Monday but I didn't push myself to do more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Typescout practice twice a week.</p>
    <p>Last year I maintained my typing speed and accuracy but kind of plateaued at 60wpm. Sometimes I touch the key on the keyboard but it doesn't register but I can't tell if I have pressed it hard enough. Even though I love my Apple full size aluminium keyboard I have decided to get a mechanical keyboard as people seem to rave about them as the epitome of all keyboards. Haven't done any practice as yet though but it is interesting typing with the keyboard in my lap.</p>
    <p>It's Sunday the 7th and my new mechanical keyboard has arrived. This thing has a lovely feel and isn't like anything that I've typed on before. It's loud though, very loud.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: 10k steps twice a week.</p>
    <p>On Monday and Tuesday in week one I have already reached my goal.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Create a routine for the month with splits, backbends and standings.</p>
    <p>I haven't yet created a routine but seem to be following a pattern similar to what I teach. Keep forgetting about the splits though.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Complete my tax return.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

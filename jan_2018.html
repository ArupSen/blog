<p>It's the 2nd of January 2018 and I haven't yet formulated a year plan. But I'm not going to let that stop me from starting to work on my goals. I have a fairly clear idea of what I want so here goes.</p>
<p>So far so good with week one. I feel very enthused about it all but still need to write out the year plan properly and also to complete the 2017 review.</p>
<p>Now into week 2 on Friday 12th it does feel that I'm on track. The main thing is that I have fully recovered from whatever I had during most of December and I feel that my energy and motivation have returned.</p>
<p>Week 3 went pretty well and I was very focused on my set of goals partly because they are fresh and new as it's the new year and also that I've been working on my 2017 review on and off throughout January.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sell one item on eBay. Discard one item from each room.</p>
    <p>I've put 2 items on eBay and threw out a load of paperwork which felt really good.</p>
    <p>During the first week of January I have been thinking about getting a bigger screen. I got quite obsessive about it and have also considered a projector. But when I sat down to think about what was prompting it all I realised that it was all about removing clutter. What I want is to remove my desk and office chair and use the computer from my sofa as I do with gaming and watching movies. Obviously when you have a new idea and get obsessive about it you want to it immediately. But I've fallen into that trap all too often. I don't want to be a buzzkill but I want to see if it's a one night stand or something more serious. Getting rid of my desk and chair would be a big change because I tend to do all of my computer related work with that set up. I used to also use my laptop and that would still be an option but to use my main computer I would have to use it without a desk with the keyboard in my lap. So I'm going to give it a couple of weeks, say till the 20th and then see if I still like the idea.</p>
    <p>The first item that I listed, a doorbell, didn't sell so I have re-listed it and have also listed a third item. Fingers crossed. It's good just to be aware of what I have that definitely needs to go and others that could potentially be discarded.</p>
    <p>By the time the 20th of the month came around I found that I had not missed my desk at all and decided to rearrange the sitting room to make it desk free and also create a bit more space. It feels more spacious and has more of a sense of being a sitting room rather than an office. The speakers were too close to the monitor which gave a sense of clutter and now that they are further apart there seems to be a better soundstage, almost a surround sound feel. It was a very satisfying weekend DIY project to do while it was raining outside.</p>
    <p>As well the sitting room changes and declutting I added many things to eBay and cleared out various things from shelves and cupboards. I've also decided to get rid of all of my DVD collection. These days I tend to stream rather than put a DVD disc into the computer so they really are redundant.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Ride at least once each week.</p>
    <p>Rode around the block a few times for about 20 minutes. Kind of exciting but alien at the same time.</p>
    <p>I commuted today (4th). First time in about 6 weeks or so. Felt good, really good. Like part of me was missing.</p>
    <p>On the 8th, 9th and 10th, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of week 2 I commuted by bike and thoroughly enjoyed it. Riding up and back from Racer Rosa in Walthamstow didn't feel as challenging or as tiring as I would have anticipated so it shows that in spite of the extreme lack of cycling during 2017 I do seem to have maintained some measure of fitness.</p>
    <p>On the 16th and the 17th I did my rides. Once was to Samaritans and the other time to Bayswater. I would have commuted on the 18th except that I had to fetch wheels from Racer Rosa but that kept up my basic quota for the week.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Skip breakfast. 16:8. Zinc gluconate.</p>
    <p>I've ordered some Zinc gluconate tablets so am just waiting for them to arrive then we'll see how it goes.</p>
    <p>I haven't been skipping breakfast and in fact have been enjoying some measure of a breakfast but I have started to take the zinc tablets. They do seem to give rise to nausea and a sensation akin to heartburn which lasts around 20 minutes or so; hopefully this is only because I'm new to it. I also feel warm despite it being winter which may have something to do with the zinc.</p>
    <p>Still taking the zinc and it seems to be fine when I take it with food. For this reason I haven't been doing the 16:8 because then I would have to wait till later to take the zinc and that could mean that I would forget.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Guitar</h4>
    <p>Goals: Play on Sunday evenings 7th and 14th.</p>
    <p>I played for about 20 minutes on Sunday evening, the 7th and as well as enjoying it very much it gave rise to looking at songs or pieces that I could learn.</p>
    <p>I did play on the 14th and spent some time looking at tutorials on YouTube and following along. I tried out a different altered tuning and it wasn't too difficult to get the gist of the song that I wanted to learn. I was looking forward to picking up on this on the 21st but it didn't happen. As I hadn't set the 21st as a goal I wasn't too bothered.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sit for 10 minutes before bed 3 times per week.</p>
    <p>I did this on Monday and Tuesday and it really felt good.</p>
    <p>I thought for some reason that I had set a goal of every day but so far I have been doing it at least 3 times a week. It's a nice way to calm down before bed I do find that it's better to read than watch before going to bed too.</p>
    <p>I really felt a reluctance to do this in week 3 and I didn't try to fight it but just acknowledged that I wanted to watch something before going to bed rather than meditate for 10 minutes. I could easily have done both but didn't.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work on Rails Tutorial once a week at library.</p>
    <p>I got up early and set up my laptop ready for the library but spent the time working on my goals.</p>
    <p>During week 2 I went twice to the library to work on Rails. On Monday to Forest Hill library where I worked for about 2 hours and then on Friday to Penge library to work for an hour. Penge is much closer and also quieter but still has people talking in the background. Taking earbuds is a must to block out the chatter and focus more fully.</p>
    <p>During week 2 I went to Forest Hill library and studied for about an hour. I did the final section of Chapter One (because even though I have started the Rails Tutorial on the main desktop computer at home, on the laptop I have started from scratch) and was setting things up on Heroku. This set me off researching cloud based hosting especially as my own hosting account went down, meaning that all of my clients websites went down too. All of this reading and research got me interested in programming and IT all over again, which can't be bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with Bleak House, use one paragraph.</p>
    <p>It's nice to read before going to bed instead of watching but not sure how long I can keep this up.</p>
    <p>I don't read quite as much in bed at night as I would during the day when I'm more awake and more focused and I wonder if knowing that I will be reading a small amount or that I have a slot designated for that activity that I tend to miss it during the day, at least that is how it feels.</p>
    <p>The 'one paragraph' technique really works. The goal is only to read one paragraph and then another one etc. During week 3 I didn't read at all in the evening before bed as the craving to watch was far too strong. But I did read at other times of the day.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do one shift at Waltham Forest.</p>
    <p>I had a look on the Waltham Forest rota but couldn't find any shifts I could sign into. They seem to have a lot more volunteers than before.</p>
    <p>All going well with my shifts at Croydon and so far I haven't scheduled a shift at Waltham Forest but I'm sure I'll fit one in at some point.</p>
    <p>I did an overnight shift during week 3 at my branch. I would like to say that I enjoyed it and I suppose I did but more than that I felt re-connected with why I volunteer. Sometimes the calls can be less than genuine but during this shift, based on the content of the calls, I would say that they were all genuine and really brought me back to my initial training. During the previous day I was focused on the other things that I had planned and felt that my Samaritans shifts were just getting in the way. But after doing this shift it felt like a totally worthwhile thing to do, something that the community really needs.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Lights out by 00:30. Read rather than watch before bed.</p>
    <p>Aside from a few nights when it was more like 01:00, all the other nights I have managed to have my eyes closed by half past midnight. Some days it has felt early and on others it hasn't. I guess it's a case of gradually changing my clock. I'm not waking up lots earlier such as 06:00 but more like 07:30 / 08:00 which means that I'm getting a good amount of sleep.</p>
    <p>I wasn't totally consistent with my sleep in week 3 and most nights I was closing my eyes a little after 00:30. I don't know if it's because it's the start of the year or if it's because I've been taking zinc but I've been very excited about everything that I've been doing and when it comes to bedtime I simply want to do more rather than go to sleep. I seem to be able to do either in that if I did choose to turn off the light and close my eyes I would be able to fall asleep immediately but instead I choose one more YouTube video or an episode of some TV series.</p>
    <p>Another thing that has been happening these past few weeks is that my dream life has become very vivid and intense. The dream world feels very realistic and I seem to remember them more clearly when I wake up. This again may be due to the zinc.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Rebuild routine following Dec 2017 lapse.</p>
    <p>Did a short one set routine on Monday which felt tough but manageable.</p>
    <p>A follow up routine on Friday again doing only one set of each exercise to gently ease myself in. Felt a lot easier than on Monday but I didn't push myself to do more.</p>
    <p>At the end of week 2 I have stepped up my session to performing 2 sets of each exercise and it didn't feel like a big deal at all to do so. Only Monday and Friday but had to skip Wednesday because I was working at the shop building wheels. Really would prefer to do it 3 times per week.</p>
    <p>In week 3 I didn't do it on Monday because as far as I remember I wasn't up for it or up to it. After my overnight on Tuesday I was quite motivated and had a great workout. I focused on scapular positioning and it focused me a great deal. On the Friday I went from 2 sets of each exercise to 3 sets per exercise. I feel that I'm now back where I was before all the breaks so it's time to start thinking about progress rather than maintenance.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Typescout practice twice a week.</p>
    <p>Last year I maintained my typing speed and accuracy but kind of plateaued at 60wpm. Sometimes I touch the key on the keyboard but it doesn't register but I can't tell if I have pressed it hard enough. Even though I love my Apple full size aluminium keyboard I have decided to get a mechanical keyboard as people seem to rave about them as the epitome of all keyboards. Haven't done any practice as yet though but it is interesting typing with the keyboard in my lap.</p>
    <p>It's Sunday the 7th and my new mechanical keyboard has arrived. This thing has a lovely feel and isn't like anything that I've typed on before. It's loud though, very loud.</p>
    <p>I've been using my new keyboard during week 2 and as well as the sound and the feel of it, I have placed it in my lap which is very different from having it on the desk. At first I was typing very slowly, well at least 10 wpm slower than what I was reaching with my regular keyboard but in less than a week I had clawed my way back.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: 10k steps twice a week.</p>
    <p>On Monday and Tuesday in week one I have already reached my goal.</p>
    <p>In week 2 there are already 2 days where I have reached the 10k mark. But today, Friday 12th I exceeded 20k!</p>
    <p>One day was a 10k and one day was a 22k. Yeah.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Create a routine for the month with splits, backbends and standings.</p>
    <p>I haven't yet created a routine but seem to be following a pattern similar to what I teach. Keep forgetting about the splits though.</p>
    <p>I did write some notes to create a routine or at least poses that would go into that routine but that was as far as I got.</p>
    <p>I've sort of been referring to the sketch that I made as a routine but not quite as concretely as I would like. But I have been using the timer and being more focused than randomly pulling postures out of the air.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Complete my tax return.</p>
    <p>It's the 12th and I haven't got very far yet.</p>
    <p>Nope, didn't happen in week 3 either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

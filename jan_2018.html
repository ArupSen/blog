<p>It's the 2nd of January 2018 and I haven't yet formulated a year plan. But I'm not going to let that stop me from starting to work on my goals. I have a fairly clear idea of what I want so here goes.</p>
<p>So far so good with week one. I feel very enthused about it all but still need to write out the year plan properly and also to complete the 2017 review.</p>
<p>Now into week 2 on Friday 12th it does feel that I'm on track. The main thing is that I have fully recovered from whatever I had during most of December and I feel that my energy and motivation have returned.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sell one item on eBay. Discard one item from each room.</p>
    <p>I've put 2 items on eBay and threw out a load of paperwork which felt really good.</p>
    <p>During the first week of January I have been thinking about getting a bigger screen. I got quite obsessive about it and have also considered a projector. But when I sat down to think about what was prompting it all I realised that it was all about removing clutter. What I want is to remove my desk and office chair and use the computer from my sofa as I do with gaming and watching movies. Obviously when you have a new idea and get obsessive about it you want to it immediately. But I've fallen into that trap all too often. I don't want to be a buzzkill but I want to see if it's a one night stand or something more serious. Getting rid of my desk and chair would be a big change because I tend to do all of my computer related work with that set up. I used to also use my laptop and that would still be an option but to use my main computer I would have to use it without a desk with the keyboard in my lap. So I'm going to give it a couple of weeks, say till the 20th and then see if I still like the idea.</p>
    <p>The first item that I listed, a doorbell, didn't sell so I have re-listed it and have also listed a third item. Fingers crossed. It's good just to be aware of what I have that definitely needs to go and others that could potentially be discarded.</p>

  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Ride at least once each week.</p>
    <p>Rode around the block a few times for about 20 minutes. Kind of exciting but alien at the same time.</p>
    <p>I commuted today (4th). First time in about 6 weeks or so. Felt good, really good. Like part of me was missing.</p>
    <p>On the 8th, 9th and 10th, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of week 2 I commuted by bike and thoroughly enjoyed it. Riding up and back from Racer Rosa in Walthamstow didn't feel as challenging or as tiring as I would have anticipated so it shows that in spite of the extreme lack of cycling during 2017 I do seem to have maintained some measure of fitness.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Skip breakfast. 16:8. Zinc gluconate.</p>
    <p>I've ordered some Zinc gluconate tablets so am just waiting for them to arrive then we'll see how it goes.</p>
    <p>I haven't been skipping breakfast and in fact have been enjoying some measure of a breakfast but I have started to take the zinc tablets. They do seem to give rise to nausea and a sensation akin to heartburn which lasts around 20 minutes or so; hopefully this is only because I'm new to it. I also feel warm despite it being winter which may have something to do with the zinc.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Guitar</h4>
    <p>Goals: Play on Sunday evenings 7th and 14th.</p>
    <p>I played for about 20 minutes on Sunday evening, the 7th and as well as enjoying it very much it gave rise to looking at songs or pieces that I could learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sit for 10 minutes before bed 3 times per week.</p>
    <p>I did this on Monday and Tuesday and it really felt good.</p>
    <p>I thought for some reason that I had set a goal of every day but so far I have been doing it at least 3 times a week. It's a nice way to calm down before bed I do find that it's better to read than watch before going to bed too.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work on Rails Tutorial once a week at library.</p>
    <p>I got up early and set up my laptop ready for the library but spent the time working on my goals.</p>
    <p>During week 2 I went twice to the library to work on Rails. On Monday to Forest Hill library where I worked for about 2 hours and then on Friday to Penge library to work for an hour. Penge is much closer and also quieter but still has people talking in the background. Taking earbuds is a must to block out the chatter and focus more fully.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with Bleak House, use one paragraph.</p>
    <p>It's nice to read before going to bed instead of watching but not sure how long I can keep this up.</p>
    <p>I don't read quite as much in bed at night as I would during the day when I'm more awake and more focused and I wonder if knowing that I will be reading a small amount or that I have a slot designated for that activity that I tend to miss it during the day, at least that is how it feels.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do one shift at Waltham Forest.</p>
    <p>I had a look on the Waltham Forest rota but couldn't find any shifts I could sign into. They seem to have a lot more volunteers than before.</p>
    <p>All going well with my shifts at Croydon and so far I haven't scheduled a shift at Waltham Forest but I'm sure I'll fit one in at some point.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Lights out by 00:30. Read rather than watch before bed.</p>
    <p>Aside from a few nights when it was more like 01:00, all the other nights I have managed to have my eyes closed by half past midnight. Some days it has felt early and on others it hasn't. I guess it's a case of gradually changing my clock. I'm not waking up lots earlier such as 06:00 but more like 07:30 / 08:00 which means that I'm getting a good amount of sleep.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Rebuild routine following Dec 2017 lapse.</p>
    <p>Did a short one set routine on Monday which felt tough but manageable.</p>
    <p>A follow up routine on Friday again doing only one set of each exercise to gently ease myself in. Felt a lot easier than on Monday but I didn't push myself to do more.</p>
    <p>At the end of week 2 I have stepped up my session to performing 2 sets of each exercise and it didn't feel like a big deal at all to do so. Only Monday and Friday but had to skip Wednesday because I was working at the shop building wheels. Really would prefer to do it 3 times per week.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Typescout practice twice a week.</p>
    <p>Last year I maintained my typing speed and accuracy but kind of plateaued at 60wpm. Sometimes I touch the key on the keyboard but it doesn't register but I can't tell if I have pressed it hard enough. Even though I love my Apple full size aluminium keyboard I have decided to get a mechanical keyboard as people seem to rave about them as the epitome of all keyboards. Haven't done any practice as yet though but it is interesting typing with the keyboard in my lap.</p>
    <p>It's Sunday the 7th and my new mechanical keyboard has arrived. This thing has a lovely feel and isn't like anything that I've typed on before. It's loud though, very loud.</p>
    <p>I've been using my new keyboard during week 2 and as well as the sound and the feel of it, I have placed it in my lap which is very different from having it on the desk. At first I was typing very slowly, well at least 10 wpm slower than what I was reaching with my regular keyboard but in less than a week I had clawed my way back.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: 10k steps twice a week.</p>
    <p>On Monday and Tuesday in week one I have already reached my goal.</p>
    <p>In week 2 there are already 2 days where I have reached the 10k mark. But today, Friday 12th I exceeded 20k!</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Create a routine for the month with splits, backbends and standings.</p>
    <p>I haven't yet created a routine but seem to be following a pattern similar to what I teach. Keep forgetting about the splits though.</p>
    <p>I did write some notes to create a routine or at least poses that would go into that routine but that was as far as I got.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Complete my tax return.</p>
    <p>It's the 12th and I haven't got very far yet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

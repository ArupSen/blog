<p>The June report (and goals for the month I guess) starts on the 21st. I moved into my new place more than a month ago but it has taken me this long to settle in and feel that I can look at my goals again (not that I haven't been pursuing them) in a more formal way. Much has happened this month which I can tick off as goals achieved. I've been reading, I have been on a short holiday, cleared loads of clutter, started cycling again after a long break and resumed strength training.</p>

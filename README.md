# Arup's Blog

Previously I kept my blogposts [in this repo](https://github.com/ArupSen/blogpost-templates) but my system of keeping each month as a branch wasn't something that I wanted to continue especially as that isn't really the way to use branches and I was also having to tie certain posts to certain months and would rather that they were independent.

This one is simply called *blog* and contains all types of blog posts whether they fit into a time period such as monthly reports or not, as well as templates for reports. I suppose for more granular control I could create a new repo for each post but my posts aren't that long or numerous.

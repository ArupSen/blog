<p>April is going to be a continuation of March essentially and building upon what I achieved, which was getting back to things after being ill for most of January and February. Spring has finally sprung and I feel that I can blow the dust off my lethargy. I'm also free from illness and have been gradually rebuilding my fitness and my strength as well as my motivation so I think that I will be able to achieve a lot through April. One of the things that I have found difficult is lowering my expectations. It's on my list of principles and it's clear that I put it there for good reason. Through March there were times when I found myself feeling worthless and that I ought to be more advanced than I am in many things: I expect a lot from myself and it is usually more than I achieve which means that I am constantly disappointed. I went over this in the yearplan but now that I'm aware of it on a day to day basis I can be working on it as a mental exercise.</p>
<p>Having pulled out of the shop in Walthamstow and also stepped down from my leadership roles with Samaritans I have regained my time and my lifestyle: I should be able to accomplish all the things on the list and have enough time for leisure, which often takes up more time than I anticipate.</p>
<p>About a week gone, today being the 7th and things are going rather well I think. The sun is out which is perhaps helping with my motivation but as well as my goals here I have also been doing well with my general todo list and various chores. I still feel lazy and lethargic a lot of the time but all of a sudden I'll get the urge to hoover and mop the flat, so I go with it. It doesn't rob me of entertainment time too much and of course leaves me feeling very good about myself and allows me to enjoy my entertainment a whole lot more.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: focus on doing my shifts, possibly filling red gaps but staying away from other things. I am still on the twitter team in spite of having stepped down from the leadership team so I will be doing a bit of that. I wanted to finish my fundraising lead role by setting up a branch eBay account but it didn't happen due to the many checks and requirements so I plan to sell items via my own eBay account even though it incurs greater fees than a proper charity account. So much for not doing other things but these shouldn't amount to much.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: nothing new this month. My plan is to continue with what I've been doing last month which is to do the practice at least twice a week. Staying focused on accuracy seems to increase speed.</p>
    <p>I've been using a workout strategy to plan my typing practice sessions. What I had been doing previously was to do 5 set of 1 minute of the Typetris game at 50 cpm (chararcters per minute) but I have now changed that to 2 x 1 set at 1 minute at 50 cpm, then 1 set at 2 minutes and then 1 (or more) sets of 1 minute at 60 cpm. This last set is very fast and I can just about make it to 30 seconds but I think it will help push me to faster speeds by improving my reaction time. I've also added back the pipe character which used to be too similar to the lower case 'L' and was indistinguishable. But now that I'm using Ubuntu rather than Mac OS, it's far easier to the spot the difference.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: last month I had a very minimal plan but I didn't really manage that so once again I'm wondering as to whether I should set a goal at all. I still would like to work through the Conquering the Command Line book and the basic Git course but that's all. Without having slots to do this I don't know when it'll happen. The slots that I've set up aren't really working so I'll have to think of other ones. I guess the goal then is to find the best slot for doing this.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Even though I have set a goal of reading 20-30 minutes a day, it usually takes longer than that to read a chapter and I do find it hard to put the book down before I have finished one. The best time for me to read is in the morning and I find it a nice start to the day. I'm tentatively setting a secondary goal of a reading day which will perhaps coincide with the new goal of having a day off each week.</p>
    <p>Now that the sun has come out it's very nice to sit in the garden with my Kindle and read: I can easily accomplish my daily reading quota this way and far more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: last month I managed to have my healthy eating day each week and this was combined with cooking. I want to repeat that this month. It may or may not be Wednesday. I also want to continue with the oily fish twice a week, which has been fairly easy to implement. In addition to this I want to lose the extra weight that I put on during the time that I was ill. I put on something like 4-5kg so if I lose it gradually I should be more or less there by the end of April. Given that this month contains Easter when there is much chocolate to be had I am not getting my hopes up too high but as long as I keep an eye on my eating habits and think about the long term I think I should be fine.</p>
    <p>I've had my healthy eating day this week and also my oily fish (sardines) and on the other days my consumption of junk food was pretty low. There was craving but not half as strong as I had expected and therefore it was very easy to overcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Having read the book, Overcoming Gravity, I seemed to have had a honeymoon period: doing handstands every day; 'greasing the groove'; adding compressions. But the book mentions that rest is just as important so this month I'm going to have a rest week or a 'deload' period. So the plan is to take a week off in week three. I also plan on getting more sleep but want to set that as a new goal for this month. I want to add back the daily handstands but gradually and keeping an eye on the state of my wrists. The same with greasing the groove. I've only read a small section of the book, enough to get me going but I need to read more.</p>
    <p>The first week of the month is complete and even though I thought that doing extra reps with drop-sets and negatives would be overdoing it, I seem to have got through it unscathed and enjoyed it very much.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: one of my friends is encouraging me to ride and plans to go on a short leisurely ride on the 9th of April. I would really like to see if my cycling mojo really has gone. Now that I'm feeling fit again (not ill) and the sun is coming out perhaps I will enjoy riding along country lanes. So I suppose the goal is to go on short easy rides with no pressure to complete or even undertake any Audax challenges.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Even though the goal of throwing something out every day or organising an area has become a bit tedious, it is nevertheless quite effective so I'm going to stick with it. One extra goal is to put an item on eBay, at least one item.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Now that I have particular postures that I want to develop such as the handstand, the upside down bow and the splits I really have no excuse with regard to not knowing what to do. I also have the principles of deep breathing and using a timer. TED talks worked well as a background but do I even need one?</p>
    <p>It seems that my splits and backbends have improved already without a great deal of effort: would that be called muscle memory or does that only apply to strength rather than suppleness? I've had a couple of distracted sessions but more focused on the practice than the thing that I'm watching. It's great to have an overall focus rather than picking postures out of the air.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: A new goal that will be added for this month. The aim is to get to bed a bit earlier say by midnight and then aiming to get at least 8 hours.</p>
    <p>My regular bedtime, if you could call it that, was around 01:30 and so far it's been between midnight and half past. I haven't been sleeping more but I believe I have been sleeping better. It's too early to tell but I also find that because I'm up earlier I'm more in a mood to get things done. Being up earlier, better rested and being in a productive mood means that I feel that when my entertainment comes around I am able to enjoy it more fully due to a sense of achievement from having completed many tasks during the day. Without any conscious designation it seems that allocate the earlier part of the day to focus on completing tasks and the latter part of the day to simply enjoying myself. I suppose that this is what most people do, so whether this comes from the collective unconscious or my own I don't know but rather than try to change what is already there (as there is really no need to do so) I can simply embrace it. By changing my sleep schedule it appears that I've stumbled upon greater productivity.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Brushing my teeth every day. Only for this month and we'll see how we go. Another new goal this month is to have a day off each week. I'm thinking that it should be Monday but any day really could be the day off. Last month I was planning to update my wheel website but it didn't happen so I'm carrying it over.</p>
    <p>On the 1st I had my first proper meal out at Wagamama. Both Maya and I had our usual favourites and we didn't experiment. As I've got out of the habit, it did feel expensive.</p>
    <p>Not only have I been brushing my teeth on a daily basis but flossing and using mouthwash. So far so good for week one.</p>
  </li>

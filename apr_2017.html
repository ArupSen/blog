<p>April is going to be a continuation of March essentially and building upon what I achieved, which was getting back to things after being ill for most of January and February. Spring has finally sprung and I feel that I can blow the dust off my lethargy. I'm also free from illness and have been gradually rebuilding my fitness and my strength as well as my motivation so I think that I will be able to achieve a lot through April. One of the things that I have found difficult is lowering my expectations. It's on my list of principles and it's clear that I put it there for good reason. Through March there were times when I found myself feeling worthless and that I ought to be more advanced than I am in many things: I expect a lot from myself and it is usually more than I achieve which means that I am constantly disappointed. I went over this in the yearplan but now that I'm aware of it on a day to day basis I can be working on it as a mental exercise.</p>
<p>Having pulled out of the shop in Walthamstow and also stepped down from my leadership roles with Samaritans I have regained my time and my lifestyle: I should be able to accomplish all the things on the list and have enough time for leisure, which often takes up more time than I anticipate.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: focus on doing my shifts, possibly filling red gaps but staying away from other things. I am still on the twitter team in spite of having stepped down from the leadership team so I will be doing a bit of that. I wanted to finish my fundraising lead role by setting up a branch eBay account but it didn't happen due to the many checks and requirements so I plan to sell items via my own eBay account even though it incurs greater fees than a proper charity account. So much for not doing other things but these shouldn't amount to much.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: nothing new this month. My plan is to continue with what I've been doing last month which is to do the practice at least twice a week. Staying focused on accuracy seems to increase speed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: last month I had a very minimal plan but I didn't really manage that so once again I'm wondering as to whether I should set a goal at all. I still would like to work through the Conquering the Command Line book and the basic Git course but that's all. Without having slots to do this I don't know when it'll happen. The slots that I've set up aren't really working so I'll have to think of other ones. I guess the goal then is to find the best slot for doing this.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Even though I have set a goal of reading 20-30 minutes a day, it usually takes longer than that to read a chapter and I do find it hard to put the book down before I have finished one. The best time for me to read is in the morning and I find it a nice start to the day. I'm tentatively setting a secondary goal of a reading day which will perhaps coincide with the new goal of having a day off each week.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: last month I managed to have my healthy eating day each week and this was combined with cooking. I want to repeat that this month. It may or may not be Wednesday. I also want to continue with the oily fish twice a week, which has been fairly easy to implement. In addition to this I want to lose the extra weight that I put on during the time that I was ill. I put on something like 4-5kg so if I lose it gradually I should be more or less there by the end of April. Given that this month contains Easter when there is much chocolate to be had I am not getting my hopes up too high but as long as I keep an eye on my eating habits and think about the long term I think I should be fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Having read the book, Overcoming Gravity, I seemed to have had a honeymoon period: doing handstands every day; 'greasing the groove'; adding compressions. But the book mentions that rest is just as important so this month I'm going to have a rest week or a 'deload' period. So the plan is to take a week off in week three. I also plan on getting more sleep but want to set that as a new goal for this month. I want to add back the daily handstands but gradually and keeping an eye on the state of my wrists. The same with greasing the groove. I've only read a small section of the book, enough to get me going but I need to read more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: one of my friends is encouraging me to ride and plans to go on a short leisurely ride on the 9th of April. I would really like to see if my cycling mojo really has gone. Now that I'm feeling fit again (not ill) and the sun is coming out perhaps I will enjoy riding along country lanes. So I suppose the goal is to go on short easy rides with no pressure to complete or even undertake any Audax challenges.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Even though the goal of throwing something out every day or organising an area has become a bit tedious, it is nevertheless quite effective so I'm going to stick with it. One extra goal is to put an item on eBay, at least one item.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Now that I have particular postures that I want to develop such as the handstand, the upside down bow and the splits I really have no excuse with regard to not knowing what to do. I also have the principles of deep breathing and using a timer. TED talks worked well as a background but do I even need one?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: A new goal that will be added for this month. The aim is to get to bed a bit earlier say by midnight and then aiming to get at least 8 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Brushing my teeth every day. Only for this month and we'll see how we go. Another new goal this month is to have a day off each week. I'm thinking that it should be Monday but any day really could be the day off. Last month I was planning to update my wheel website but it didn't happen so I'm carrying it over.</p>
    <p>On the 1st I had my first proper meal out at Wagamama. Both Maya and I had our usual favourites and we didn't experiment. As I've got out of the habit, it did feel expensive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

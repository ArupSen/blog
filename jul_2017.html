<p>It's the 3rd of July and really the first time since my house move that I am sitting down at my computer to work on my goals. As I mentioned in the previous report, even though I haven't been formally scrutinising my goals and looking at the details in the way that I usually do, I have still been pursuing them, so all has not been lost. But it's about time to get back to my original plan for the year, which will also be reviewed and updated since another 3 months have passed. But what about July? What do I want to work on and achieve in July? Is it time to remove redundant goals that no longer apply and perhaps add new ones that have been knocking at the door waiting to be let in?</p>
<p>We fast forward to the 19th of July. The school holidays are about to start and summer is well under way. I am starting to feel settled at my new home after about 2 months or so. Today we had a new boiler installed which took up most of the day. I got on with odd jobs and fasted. I'm sort of in touch with my goals and sort of not. I'm in touch with them in the sense that I do think about them and almost out of habit because they haven't changed in a very long time I remember I could or should be doing such a thing. I'm not in touch with them because I haven't been looking at the year plan or my goals for the month. But it does feel like things are moving forward even though I'm not formally keeping track.</p>
<p>Last month was busy with all the extra yoga classes and working at the shop but now that the classes are back to their usual number it doesn't really feel less busy. I still have a lot of work at the shop and I'm still getting used to this lifestyle of separating home and work. Because it is such a long commute I try and do as much as I can while I'm there and make it a long day: a typical day would be from 10am till 10pm. I don't really pursue my goals on those days; I can't do yoga, strength training, read or work on my typing skills. I can read a little on my tube journeys but usually get distracted by emails and messages or try hard to stay awake. I get the sense that I'm more productive because when I'm there, I'm there to work rather than work interspersed with a lot of play. It's a bit like a fasting day where I am able to put off my urge to enjoy food till the next day. It's focused work and something that has been necessary due to the heavy demand of late.</p>
<p>At the start of July it being the end of half of the year I was meant to update the year plan and set goals for the next three months but now July is over as it's the 2nd of August so it's time to wrap things up and simply complete my monthly report. I do feel that I'm back on top of things again. I do feel a little guilty that I have missed a lot and that I should be more connected to my goals and working on them during more of my waking hours but having read through my year plan one of my main principles or guidelines for this year was to lower my expectations. It's OK. I'm OK. It'll all be fine.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: </p>
    <p>I haven't set a goal for this month but I suppose the goal is to just do my shifts without taking on extra things. But now that I haven't been on the Leadership team and taken a break from mentoring I want to do something again especially now that I feel more settled. I've put my name forward for being a mentor on the next intake. That depends on whether I get 'matched'. I've stepped away from being in charge of the branch website and shown another volunteer how to take care of it. They have already created a new page about the car boot sale at Ashburton Park in September. I also went to visit the Waltham Forest branch as it is so close to the Racer Rosa shop so that on the days that I work in E17 I can possibly do a shift there.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with 2-3 times a week practice.</p>
    <p>I've been practicing and I've been enjoying it but I still seem to be maintaining rather than progressing. But that is something I guess.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: No goal this month.</p>
    <p>The reminders that I set for doing 2-3 hours a week still go off and I wonder if I should remove them: I can't really see myself doing any more programming this year. I'm starting to feel more and more comfortable with that idea.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: continue with my Dickens goal.</p>
    <p>I have been continuing with Dombey and Son. I may have mentioned this in a previous report but it feels like a very long book. There were sections where it really dragged and seemed to dwell too much on one part of the story but now that I'm getting close to 80% the pace has really changed and it feels more like a TV drama. Some of the seemingly disconnected characters are gradually coming together but the story still seems like two books rather than one but then the books were originally serialised which explains the great length of them.</p>
    <p>I'm now 98% of the way through the book which means I'm almost at the end. It's been a very long book.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: No goal, just enjoy food on my non-fasting days.</p>
    <p>I really have been enjoying my food. Now that I live closer to the chippy near Penge East station I have been making the most of it. I have been giving myself free reign to eat what I like, when I like and as much as I like. I've also been enjoying alcohol, mainly beer and cider.</p>
    <p>I've had dinner tonight supplied by the Penge East chippy and I enjoyed it very much. I have just had two cases of beer from the Wild Card Brewery called the Queen of Diamonds delivered to me so I can no longer consider myself alcohol free. It's nice to be enjoying myself again. But I am slowly re-introducing nutritional principles back into my diet. I've been thinking about protein, fibre etc., etc. There was one week this month that I even fasted for 3 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Re-establish 3 sets per exercise. Push rep range to 8-12. Build daily handstand practice gradually.</p>
    <p>I have been pushing up my rep range and have also started to do three sets of all the main exercises. It somehow feels more solid and firm in this flat. Doing the bodyline drills and handstands is much easier on carpet. I seem to be able to balance for a second or two longer in the handstands too. I haven't yet re-introduced the 'greasing the groove' technique or doing handstands every day but it does feel good to be able set a slot and stick to that slot. What I mean is that because I have been working long days at the shop in Walthamstow I have had to miss my sessions sometimes at my previous slots and have been doing only two sessions a week. But that means when I schedule a time I really have to do it at that time or it just won't happen. One time I went to Ikea and started training immediately upon my return. I also trained one time straight after coming home from a Samaritans shift. I still can't help feeling that I should be more advanced but how would that be possible if I have been having breaks from training?</p>
    <p>I've been very consistent with my training even though some weeks it has been only twice. I've trained while Maya has been around and she likes to join in. The reps have been going up steadily and I've been thinking a little about diet and sleep to help enhance my efforts.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Just to ride 2-3 times a week, whatever the distance. A longer pleasure ride one day.</p>
    <p>I have been very reluctant to ride and have been making excuses when the opportunity to ride arose. I hardly rode at all in July. For the final 2 weeks I didn't even use my bike. On the final day of the month I decided to commute by bike and got a puncture ten minutes into the ride. I changed the tube and carried on only to find that the valve core wasn't secure which caused the tyre to go down. I borrowed a pair of pliers from a friend and that allowed me to secure the valve core and get myself home.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep selling one item per week on eBay. Organise stuff into new locations.</p>
    <p>Yep, plenty of eBay sales. I've sold 4 items this month and really just want to keep the momentum going without making it all too onerous. It's nice to get the cash coming in and to know that I don't need to think about that item any more.</p>
    <p>I sold my cycling training rollers as I hadn't used them for a long time and couldn't see myself using them much here in the new flat.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: </p>
    <p>There wasn't a goal set but I have been doing as much as I can. Mainly improvised and stretching the parts that are stiff. I did have a plan to add elements from my strength training into my yoga sessions such as back arching, splits work and handstands but not this month.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: </p>
    <p>I've booked another trip to visit friends in Geneva again. It was a case of why not. I have the time, I have some extra money and of course I have the inclination.</p>
    <p>On a couple of occasions I had beer and sourdough pizza with friends which I guess counts as eating out.</p>
    <p>One of my regular yoga clients stopped taking classes for a while, from February till mid-July which meant that my earnings actually went down rather than up. But during July I had a lot of extra wheel building clients, got that regular client back and also the promise of a new regular yoga class. Along with this I have decreased regular outgoings so overall I am doing OK financially. Let's hope that continues.</p>
    <p>I have thought about the day off but haven't really done much about implementing it as such. The separation of home and work seems to be helping in that respect: now that I am no longer able to work from home building wheels and work exclusively from the shop, when I'm at home I tend to relax and not worry too much about work.</p>
    <p>I'm getting the hang of the new kitchen and finding my way there. I'm in two minds about the new induction hob. It's not gas but then then it's not the awful electric rings either. I'll get there.</p>

<!-- title is 10 Unexpected Benefits of the Carnivore Diet -->
<p>Last year in August 2018 I started following the Carnivore Diet, which essentially means eating only foods that are derived from animals and not consuming any foods that are plant based. Within a few short weeks I began to notice the following unexpected benefits. I say unexpected because I did it mainly as a trial so didn't really know what to expect. Prior to doing this I had been following a ketogenic diet for 5 months. These benefits are not in any particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of dizziness and head rushes</li>
<li>Improved skin tone</li>
<li>Increased Strength</li>
<li>Steady energy</li>
<li>Better mental focus</li>
<li>Reduced hunger</li>
<li>Less attached to food</li>
<li>Improved digestion</li>
<li>Lifting of mood</li>
<li>Lower food bill</li>
</ul>
<p>Without going into detail about why I did it or what I ate, I want to discuss the results that I experienced and that they were not effects that I was expecting. Some were as early as a few weeks and others came a bit later.</p>
<h4>Bye bye head rushes</h4>
<p>Dizziness; feeling faint to the point where I thought I was about to black out. This was an everyday occurrence for me and I had developed strategies to work around them. They would be particularly noticeable during a fast and when I got out of the bath. I would hold a nearby wall in readiness and wait till the feeling had passed. Some days they would also occur while I was teaching a yoga class if I was particularly tired from a long cycle ride or had slept badly. What I noticed after going Carnivore was that these either became so minimised that I didn't notice them or that they just didn't happen at all. Now I still hold on to a wall when I get out of the bath but I don't see stars or feel in any way dizzy.</p>
<h4>Baby soft skin</h4>
<p>You know how good your skin feels when you get out of the shower or bath and apply some moisturiser or baby oil (in my case). Now my skin feels like that all the time. At first I couldn't believe it and I kept gently stroking my body to feel that it was true and that I had not imagined it. Better still, some of the drier areas improved their tone and continue to do so.</p>
<h4>Increased Strength</h4>
<p>I have been strength training with bodyweight calisthenics for many years and more recently with kettlebells. Progress has been slow but quite steady and I have sense of how fast I make progress and how my strength and motivation can fluctuate a great deal. But once my diet changed my training got more consistent with minimal fluctuations and progress began to speed up. At first this seemed like a big change which I found astonishing as though I had recovered better or had taken some sort of stimulant but it was all down to the meat. I'm going from strength to strength.</p>
<h4>Steady Energy</h4>
<p>I started intermittent fasting in 2014 with 5:2 and in 2018 I changed to the 16:8 fasting protocol. I was therefore very accustomed to the fasted state and how I could be in fat burning mode all day. My energy was steady ... ish. It wouldn't fluctuate too much during the day but the level would be unpredictable and some days were lower than others and I couldn't count on it to be a certain level. But all that has changed. Going Carnivore meant that I was in the fasted state for longer, not as a plan but it just seemed to work out that way. My first meal of the day just got later and later and the two meals that I ate got closer and closer together. With my energy higher and steadier I almost forgot about eating and food.</p>
<h4>Better mental focus</h4>
<p>It's easy to get distracted; to think about all the other cares and concerns that you have aside from the one that you are focused on (or at least meant to be focused on) at the moment. But on the Carnivore diet I could see those potential distractions sneaking up on me well ahead of their purpose and with only a sidelong glance cause them to think again. As well as the lack of distraction, creative ideas connected with the task at hand would come to mind: a double whammy of focus and concentration. There was a real wow factor at first with an incredulous,"How did I manage that?", but now I accept it as normal and I accept the change that I can expect to remain focused on what I am doing rather than get distracted. In fact, now, all too often I get overly enthused on what I am doing that I can't put it down in order to move on to the next thing on the list.</p>
<h4>Reduced hunger</h4>
<p>I have already alluded to this when I mentioned the steady energy while fasting. But on some days during fasted hours I would experience hunger especially when I used to eat carbs. Even during my brief period of following the ketogenic diet (for 5 months) I would think about what I might consume when I was inside my eating window. Since becoming fully Carnivore the thought of food and eating moved very much to the back burner even if I was out food shopping or people around me happened to be eating. I never had to use willpower during my 5:2 days, but I do remember that some days were easier than others and I couldn't easily predict at the start of the day if that day of fasting would involve feelings of hunger. Nowadays I can predict, at least in 90% of cases, that feelings of hunger will not arise. The actual feeling of hunger itself also changed. It was no longer the urgent often termed 'hangry' feeling but the sensation creeps up on you slowly and it's clear that you need to eat but if you need to wait another hour or so then you won't destroy the world around you to get a loaf of bread. This brings me nicely to the next point.</p>
<h4>Variety ain't the spice of life</h4>
<p>I was what you might have called a 'foodie'. I enjoyed trying new foods, trying out new recipes, planning what I ate and cooking for others. I even cooked for others at their homes and of course was welcomed with open arms. Conversations would centre around food and menus we had tried or would like to try as well as where to source those ingredients. But all that has changed. Friends still want to talk cuisine and gastronomy; they still share pictures of great dishes that they have enjoyed. But these are more often than not, carbohydrate laden dishes which would not be part of my own menu anytime soon. Even if the dish happened to be one that could be included within my current regimen, I am not seeking variety and am content to eat the same meals repeatedly with minimal changes. I no longer see food as a hobby even though it was very much so in the past. In the six months or so that I have been following a Carnivore diet I have tried some options and have settled on a meal plan that works for me. I eat burgers both ready made and home made from mince meat. I eat pork shoulder steaks butter basted. I eat sausages and eggs. I sometimes eat fish as well as chicken and lamb. I also eat a lot of cheese as a side dish. But that's it. Sometimes I look at recipes or consider possible alternatives but it's a cursory interest compared to my former self. It's as though I have signed a phone contract for 18 or 24 months where I have a certain number of minutes, texts and data. I spend less time talking, thinking and planning food. I spend a lot less time cooking and eating too. And less time clearing up of course. Food is no longer entertainment. I still enjoy it of course and look forward to it but not in the same way. A very unexpected change indeed.</p>
<h4>Improved Digestion</h4>
<p>There were some foods that I could digest with no problems at all and others would give me indigestion, gas, cramps and diarrhoea. But it was a bit unpredictable and of course painful and frustrating when it happened. When I switched from a regular diet to a ketogenic one, I found that I had fewer digestive issues but there were still the occasional problems which seemed to be regular. I made a habit of allowing a few hours prior to leaving the house just in case of there being liquid stool. What was frustrating other than it actually happening was not knowing if it would happen. Perhaps some gurgling during the meal would occur but that didn't mean anything. The increased fat intake I believe did take some adjustment but I would have assumed that in the 5 months that I followed the ketogenic diet it would have settled down. Once I had eliminated carbohydrates altogether, initially things got worse: I swung between diarrhoea and constipation for about 3 weeks but without any indigestion or cramps. After that initial period it all just settled down. I could throw a large amount of butter into the pan to butter baste a steak and even eat a big chunk of cheese alongside that and my stomach and intestines remained quiet. At first I couldn't eat as much meat as I can now. I would eat 4 quarter pound beef burgers and feel very full but now I need more than that, perhaps a chunk of cheese and a couple of sausages or a few eggs. My stomach continues to remain quiet and as they say, no news is good news. I hadn't expected this but as you can imagine, it's a very welcome change.</p>
<h4>Elevated Mood</h4>
<p>During the latter half of 2018 my mood was very low most of the time. I had had a tough year and from the summer onwards I felt very overwhelmed by everything and often felt that I wouldn't make it. I hung in there but had lost hope and confidence. It was subtle at first but I began to notice that my mood was gradually lifting. I'm not sure if I should attribute this change entirely to my change in diet but I'm pretty sure that it can't be a coincidence. What I noticed was that when I felt low it would last for less time and would not be quite as low as the previous time that it happened. This continued until it disappeared altogether. In fact, it then started to move in the other direction; instead of my inner voice telling me that I wouldn't make it, it began to say that if I could stay focused, perhaps I might just make it, that I was in with a chance, as much of a chance as the next person. Not only had my hope and confidence been restored but they seemed upgraded and occupied a stronger baseline than I remembered. This was quite the turnaround and those that had kindly listened to me during my times of despair were quite astonished at the change. As I said, I cannot directly attribute this to the eating of only meat and I did other things such as talking about my feelings at length with friends, meditating and journalling, all of which surely helped. I have been through episodes such as this in the past and turned to strategies that worked before but the turnaround was not as quick and during the recovery period shall we say, there was no real palpable indication that recovery was indeed taking place. In the back of my mind I still assume this change to be temporary and I will at some point come down from my 'high'. But this so called 'high' has become my baseline and the longer it lasts the longer I come to accept it as the norm and the state of mind in which I can expect to find myself for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h4>Reduced Costs</h4>
<p>I really would not have expected this one. Most of us tend to assume that meat is expensive and eating a diet consisting entirely of meat would increase my food bill a great deal. So how come my food bill went down? First of all I don't buy the grass fed organic meat that I thought I was supposed to eat. I came across articles and posts where people were following this diet with cheap cuts of meat from their local supermarket. I decided to do the same. I also shopped at the cheaper supermarkets, again assuming that my costs would sky rocket. But my average daily cost was roughly 5.00 GBP. Snacking and eating out went by the wayside. When I was out of the house in the past I would pop into a shop and get a snack: a bar of chocolate, a packet of crisps or a piece of cake perhaps. Sometimes a samosa or a sausage roll. I would buy take away food from the local chip shops but all that just stopped. There were also no snacks at home such as biscuits, muffins, etc. I used to eat a lot of toast as a snack with sweet or savoury spreads but all of that stopped too. The hunger and the craving simply wasn't there so there was no need to satisfy it. Once I had eaten my meal that was my feeding done and if I did happen to be hungry after what I thought would suffice, I simply ate more until I was full. Easy. My food bill was more or less halved. Hence if I did want to eat out and spend money eating a steak at a restaurant, something which I might have thought extravagant in the past, this would still have been inside my previous food budget even if I did it once or twice a week.</p>
<p>So there you have it; 10 unexpected benefits from eating a Carnivore diet. I didn't have any medical conditions and didn't go into this as some people do as a means of treating an ailment. My reasoning was purely curiousity and I thought that after a few weeks I would go back to my ketogenic diet as it was working well. But six months later, as I write this, the 'experiment' continues and having experienced all of these unexpected benefits, I can safely say I am feeling the best I have ever felt and see no reason to stop. It has become one of the pillars of my life and as such will continue to support me. A quality of life upgrade simply by eliminating plants from my diet.</p>

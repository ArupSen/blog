<p>In March 2018 I started to follow a diet of 'meat and greens' loosely based on the recommendations of Elliot Hulse and Jordan Peterson. It was a way to wean myself off the junk food that I had been eating on the 5 days when I'm not fasting. For many years (as of this writing, in May 2018, it's approaching 4 years of the 5:2 diet) I thought that because I was fasting for 2 days a week I could get away with eating whatever I liked without putting on weight. To a greater or lesser extent this was true. Whenever I would overindulge and go over my goal weight by a kilo or a half, I would fast for 3 days rather than 2 that week and would find myself back at my goal weight the following week. But diet, that is to say, a way of eating, is not merely about losing or gaining weight but also about nutrition and health. This was always at the back of my mind when I overindulged in junk food such as multipacks of chocolate bars, whole packs of biscuits, fast food or crisps but I enjoyed it and my rationale was that if it did kill me I would have enjoyed myself rather than refrained from so called unhealthy food in order to live longer. But during the early part of 2018 I had not been keeping track of my weight and was now more than the usual one or half kilo over my goal weight: around 3.5kg over! Fasting an extra day wouldn't remedy this and more to the point, my premise of being able to get away with eating masses of junk food no longer held true. Something had clearly changed: either I was eating more than I used to or fasting for 2 days wasn't enough to balance it out. A bigger change was required, initially to shed the excess weight but also a way of eating that I would be able to sustain for a longer ongoing period.</p>
<p>The main ideas behind my initial plan was to eat 'clean' or unprocessed food. Lean meats, fish and eggs with leafy green vegetables along with some beans and pulses. This would be for a month or so to lose the weight that I had gained and then to see if this way of eating would prove to be a way that I could then continue for a longer time. About 2 weeks into this month though I got ill. I'm pretty sure that I had the flu as it was so bad that I had to either sleep or lie down. This initial period lasted just over a week and I was completely off my food. It was almost a week of fasting with very small meals. Food tasted bitter and metallic so I just avoided it. As I started to improve and began eating again I kept my diet as clean as I could but did a lot of reading and research into how I would carry on. I felt as though I hadn't really done the diet that I had outlined so I would continue into April to see what would happen. The enforced fasting caused me to lose nearly all of the weight that I'd put on so it was no longer about weight but about health and well being.</p>
<p>I researched quite a number of diets. The low carb high fat diet often abbreviated to LCHF. The Atkins diet which I actually tried for a short period in 2002. The ketogenic diet. The slow carb diet developed by Tim Ferris. The steak and eggs diet. The Paleo diet and the Zero carb diet. These were the ones that seemed to attract me the most and they all had one thing in common: eliminate sugar and carbohydrates from the diet. I settled for something that was very close to the ketogenic diet. I even wrote a simple web app to calculate my macros to verify that I was inside the keto macro guidelines to enter a state of ketosis, where the body uses primarily fat as fuel over sugars. I read that it could take up to 90 days for the body to fully fat adapt. Given that I have been intermittent fasting for almost 4 years I can sort of assume already being fat adapted but decided to go for the 90 days nevertheless.</p>
<p>In addition to the 5:2 protocol on my usual days of Monday and Friday I added the 16:8 protocol of intermittent fasting on the other 5 days. This seemed a little strange at first but didn't take me long to adjust. As well as increased fat burning the fasted state would promote the production of human growth hormone, encourage autophagy, steady energy and even increased muscle mass purely from having a shorter eating window or what Sachin Panda from the University of San Diego was calling 'Time restricted eating'.</p>
<p>Having evolved slightly since my initial ideas, now that I'm almost at the end of the 90 days, it has stayed much the same since the end of March till the end of May. Still doing 5:2 intermittent fasting on Mondays and Fridays, 16:8 on the Other 5 days, eating only two meals, zero sugar and minimal carbohydrates only in the form of green vegetables. A diet high in fat with plenty of butter and coconut oil. I've been fairly unimaginative with my meals and once I had settled on a couple of dishes I stuck with them. For breakfast (taking place in the late morning or even at lunchtime) it would be bacon and eggs with kale. In the evening it would be pork shoulder steaks with broccoli. Snacks of nuts, cheeses and pork scratchings. When I was working at the shop I took food with me such as avocado and mozzarella.</p>
<p>Moving into June I am thinking about how this could work longer term now that the intial 90 days have passed. I'm enjoying it and I want to continue but I know that I can't be as strict as I have been so far. I know that there will be social situations where there will only be carbs on offer and there will be times when I will actually want to eat carbs such as cake or chips. Sometimes I will need to extend the eating window and I will also want to try other foods. I'm playing with these ideas during June and seeing how I can factor them into my current eating regime to formulate a robust long term strategy that will have a mix of health, weight maintenance, flexiblity and indulgence. I've managed to easily keep up the 5:2 diet for four years which is a testament to show that when you find something that works for you it's possible keep it going for a long time. It gives me confidence then that it's also possible to now take my diet to the next level, cutting out the junk food, sugar and carbs and yet not feel deprived, starved or restricted.</p>

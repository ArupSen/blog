<p>I'm setting my goals for November about halfway through the month on the 13th. Not really sure why I'm even bothering though as it was pretty much ignored in October. So far this month I've been binge watching a TV series called The Walking Dead and playing a video game called Fallout: New Vegas. Both of these can take up a great deal of time, often the majority of the day. It's a follow on from the days I took off around the time of my birthday at the end of October. I don't have a lot of work on currently, which should ideally be a time to catch up on to do items that have been lingering on the list but entertainment seems to be rather more important.</p>
<p>Even though my goals right now may not be what I had in mind at the start of the year, I still think about things that I'd like to do and get done, which can be defined as goals. Even a cursory glance at the plan for the year shows that I do still want most of those things that I set out to achieve at the start of the year and in fact now I'm even in a better position to achieve them because I know what works and what doesn't. This is to make my life easier, not harder and to that extent it should not be seen as a chore or an imposition but as an aid or guide.</p>
<p>I've added this list of goals to my Evernote shortcuts and from there I can look at them more regularly than only looking at them when I have a terminal open on my main computer. Now that I have made my goals a bit more specific, I think it would be good if I could keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>I had a think about adding meditation as a goal mainly because I've been talking about lately as it has been coming up in conversation. During the 90's I was a full time Buddhist and practised meditation for around 3 hours a day as well as going on various retreats during the year. I can't commit myself to that extent because I have so many other pursuits but would be disappointed unless I did so. When I thought about I couldn't really think of a reason for setting meditation as a goal and didn't even like the idea of committing myself to 20 minutes twice a week. This aversion to the idea even in principle decided it for me and showed me that it was perhaps something that I ought to do as a way to re-establish my identity when talking on the subject and add weight to my statements by showing that I do indeed practice. But that for me isn't a good enough reason.</p>
<p>The next day, having deciding not to add meditation as a goal, I wanted to meditate. Why? In order to get in more in touch with how I really am. I do morning pages every morning for half an hour and because I do it every day I'm sort of used to it and in some ways I can hide what is really going on. Since becoming a Samaritan and asking callers to focus on their feelings and emotions, I am also asking myself to do the same. Of course the Morning Pages should be free, totally free and asking myself to focus on feelings is an antithesis to the idea and puts pressure on myself to write a certain way. But perhaps I can do this when I meditate. Perhaps I can look beneath the surface and just allow myself to feel what is actually going on. This made sense. Here was a clear reason to meditate. I've just had to move house, I don't know what I'm doing work wise and of my goals I wonder why I continue. To help me connect with myself I write, I talk to friends but I can also meditate: not to develop concentration, not to contemplate the ultimate truth or develop universal loving kindness but just to sit with whatever is there. But for how long? How many times a week? That all depends on how I feel.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Finish with current mentee and consider new rota.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with a minimum of 2-3 sessions a week.</p>
    <p>This week's two sessions already done.</p>
    <p>I was getting frustrated again with the fact that I'm not really improving that much. I've been at around the 55 wpm mark for a good long while, perhaps 18 months and it feels very discouraging. Is the amount that I'm doing not enough? Should I do more? Should I practice in a different way? I usually start with Typetris for 1 minute at 50 cps and do this until I can complete one minute. But I tried it 60 cps and found that my speed did indeed increase, so it seems that I need to push myself a little bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Complete chapters 3, 4 and 5 of Rails Tutorial.</p>
    <p>I've made a start on chapter 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Continue with and complete David Copperfield.</p>
    <p>Since setting this goal I have made good progress and have only 2 chapters left to read. Still have more than 10 days to achieve this so I'm starting to wonder about the next book: should it be another Dickens or should it be by a different author?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: One portion of fruit or veg every day.</p>
    <p>Had some pomegranate yesterday.</p>
    <p>Right now even one portion is difficult. I seem to be indulging in whatever really that is comforting and tasty but at the same time worrying about the effect that it is having on my health; perhaps the reason I've been getting ill repeatedly this year. I've been considering doing an extra day of fasting every month to try to curb the over-eating but perhaps combining the 5:2 with the 16:8 (eating all your calories within an 8 hour window in a 24-hour period). Today (Sunday) I skipped breakfast and didn't have my first meal until 2.30pm. I need a way of allowing myself to indulge and also limit the over-eating (oh and reduce my percentage bodyfat). Is there a way to do both?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Maintain current routine and handstands on weekends.</p>
    <p>I've been taking it easy this week 13-19 because I've had a cold and one of the main symptoms was a great lack of energy. I did a very short workout but didn't skip it altogether. It felt good just to keep it going. This weekend, the 18/19th I didn't do any handstands even though I did think about it during my yoga session and then found that I had skipped it by the time I had finished. But then on Sunday I did add it to my yoga session.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Cycle twice each week.</p>
    <p>Not going to happen this week as I've got a cold and not feeling well enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sell at least one item on eBay.</p>
    <p>I've added a t-shirt that I got as a gift which is still brand new with tag so I should be able to sell it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do yoga every day with splits and backbends.</p>
    <p>Missed Tuesday and Wednesday already this week: excuse; cold.</p>
    <p>Did a short session even with Maya here and then of course on Saturday as mentioned above. Sunday was a somewhat distracted session i.e. while watching an episode of a TV series but when the episode finished I continued to practice, doing handstands, splits and backbends. By the end of the session I felt that I had something that I could set up as a regular routine to work on either in a focused or unfocused way, at least for the next couple of weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Lights out by 00:30.</p>
    <p>Due to the game I've been playing this one hasn't been easy. I take a look at the clock and see that it's around midnight and should start thinking about going to bed but then I look again and see that it's 01:30.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Visit a friend out of town on the 28th.</p>
    <p>Visit has been arranged so far so good.</p>
    <p>As well as this goal of visiting a friend out of town I have been looking at my other one-off goals for the year. I have bought a couple of items of clothing this month, one being a birthday present to myself; a winter jacket. I got it from Superdry in Croydon and it was recommended by friends and certainly is very warm. I've also bought a pair of new jeans on eBay. I've eaten out at a restaurant and am planning another one next week. I made a quiche this week, something that I had planned to do at the end of July but it didn't happen until November. I have been thinking a great deal about making more money and to that end have been in discussion with some potential yoga students as well as a venue where they would be interested in attending a class. In the end we couldn't find a mutual time slot.</p>

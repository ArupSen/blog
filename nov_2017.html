<p>I'm setting my goals for November about halfway through the month on the 13th. Not really sure why I'm even bothering though as it was pretty much ignored in October. So far this month I've been binge watching a TV series called The Walking Dead and playing a video game called Fallout: New Vegas. Both of these can take up a great deal of time, often the majority of the day. It's a follow on from the days I took off around the time of my birthday at the end of October. I don't have a lot of work on currently, which should ideally be a time to catch up on to do items that have been lingering on the list but entertainment seems to be rather more important.</p>
<p>Even though my goals right now may not be what I had in mind at the start of the year, I still think about things that I'd like to do and get done, which can be defined as goals. Even a cursory glance at the plan for the year shows that I do still want most of those things that I set out to achieve at the start of the year and in fact now I'm even in a better position to achieve them because I know what works and what doesn't. This is to make my life easier, not harder and to that extent it should not be seen as a chore or an imposition but as an aid or guide.</p>
<p>I've added this list of goals to my Evernote shortcuts and from there I can look at them more regularly than only looking at them when I have a terminal open on my main computer. Now that I have made my goals a bit more specific, I think it would be good if I could keep an eye on them.</p>

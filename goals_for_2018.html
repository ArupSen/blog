<p>Here are the goals for 2018. A lot of them are carried over from 2017 with a few additions. I didn't think through any particular new strategies as I had prior to the start of 2017 because they worked well and can also be carried over.</p>
<p>Here are some guiding principles which I tend to use anyway but thought that it might be a good idea to make them more explicit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SMART goal setting</li>
  <li>Clarity and specificity</li>
  <li>80/20 thinking</li>
  <li>Factor in TV and gaming</li>
  <li>Make goals and targets shorter term - like the one paragraph goal with reading</li>
  <li>Being focused while doing things - noticing preoccupations or distractions (could be main goal)</li>
  <li>What could be removed from my life?</li>
  <li>Be very clear and precise about the task I am setting as well as the amount of time required</li>
  <li>Commitment: what can I commit to; what am I committed to?</li>
  <li>Put goals on pause rather than remove them</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to try and keep the plan fairly short reading so that I don't feel that it's a burden to read each month.</p>
<p>The other thing that I want to do this year is to review every three months or so but that could be earlier or later depending on how I'm progressing. And rather than writing lengthy descriptions about the nature of the goals as I've done in previous years, this year I'm doing it more like a month plan, thinking of the year as a very long month. There is also the fact that this plan is being written after the year had started and goals for January and February were already in place: those goals will be influencing the year plan.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Discard all unused and unloved items.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Commute regularly, go on rides.</p>
    <p>Essentially pick up where I left off in 2016 but not necessarily doing lot of Audax. 2017 was a cycling vacuum. I do enjoy my bike riding and I want to reinstate it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals:  16:8 into 5:2, Getting ripped</p>
    <p>I know that I'm going to keep going with the 5:2 so there is no need to set that as a goal in the same way that it isn't necessary to set morning pages as a goal: it's such a part of my life now that it just happens. It's the other 5 non-fasting days that I need to address. Towards the end of 2017 and during the early part of 2018 junk food became my mainstay which I have to say was a lot of fun but it's a party that has to come to an end. The quality of my nutrition dropped very low and it is a cause for concern. The feeling of concern comes and goes but the trigger that made me stop and take stock of the situation was the increase in bodyweight. The beauty of the 5:2 fasting diet is that during the 5 non-fasting days you are free to eat as you please but I suppose that means within reason and without constantly overindulging. My ideal weight is between 58 and 60 kg and at the start of the year I was around 64kg. I had not been weighing myself during this period of overindulgence and so wasn't able to stop it before it got out of hand. Normally if I exceed my upper limit by a kilo I simply fast an extra day that week which brings back inside my accepted range. So for the first part of the year I will have to focus on getting my weight down again or it will continue to creep up.</p>
    <p>The other reason to try and kerb my overindulgence with junk food (not that I want to quit completely) is that I feel that I'm not supporting my strength training by eating such a poor diet. I should be eating more protein and fresh vegetables. I feel embarrassed to say it but I do like the idea of getting ripped. I was only ripped once in my life when I was doing the Zone diet. It wasn't really sustainable but at least a short while I could look in the mirror and see a six-pack. I'm not into bodybuilding as such but would like to see the fruits of my labours in a visual aesthetic way. The only way to do that would be to get my bodyfat low enough to make the muscle definition visible.</p>
    <p>I've started taking a zinc gluconate supplement every day as a means to boost my immune system after all the illness that I suffered last year. January and February have passed and I've just bought a pack of a hundred tablets so that is the next 3-4 months covered.</p>
    <p>Even before the weigh in I could already sense that there was a problem that I needed to address and rather than cut junk food and opt for healthier more nutritious food I was looking for a means to keep enjoying it but cut down on the amount. To this end I was experimenting with integrating the 16:8 fasting protocol into my existing 5:2. Skipping breakfast and eating dinner a bit earlier. It worked for a little while but I couldn't tell if it was working or not. I also found it too restricting to only eat within an eight hour window. When I first started taking zinc on an empty stomach it caused some discomfort: headache, heartburn sensations and nausea. Totally fine with food so breakfast was back in my life. But now I'm fine with it on an empty stomach. I think that rather than do 16:8 on all of the 5 days it's much easier for me to have a third fasting day as and when needed.</p>
    <p>One more thing that I should mention in this already long account is that of water. On those days that I was skipping breakfast and commuting to the shop I went without any water or tea. I would then drink very little water the rest of the day. On some days I would drink beer and consider that liquid enough and thus would not consider water.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Friends</h4>
    <p>Goals: Meeting friends regularly. Visiting Friends out of town</p>
    <p>I would like to say that it's all organic and happens naturally but that isn't the case. Without some level of management it really doesn't happen. Some scheduling and reminders are required.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Guitar</h4>
    <p>Goals: </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep learning. Keep it fun.</p>
    <p>The year started with a real verve for learning Rails and going to the library to study. I went there with my laptop and worked on the Rails Tutorial but in February even though my interest in programming remained intact I was no longer doing any Rails at the library but studying command line and bash at home. Mainly due to my new desk free set up along with my new mechanical keyboard.</p>
    <p>What I've found with programming is that I need to follow my whims. If I see that I'm interested in a particular topic, say functional programming and then try to follow that up by signing up to a course or working through a book, my interest slowly disappears. Right now I'm into command line and bash scripting. I'm enjoying it. But I don't have a long term goal. I could find myself some sort of fat tome which might be regarded as the bash bible (bible basher?) and start working through it. But I know that would be more than likely a buzz kill. The goal is programming, learning to solve problems using the computer and that can take on many forms. It's fun and exciting and I want to keep it that way rather than box myself into something.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Dickens ongoing. Reading days. Other books. Audio books.</p>
    <p>Now into my third year of reading Dickens. In the first two years I have read eight of his works and if I continue at the same pace then this year I will read another four. Alongside Dickens I will also be reading other books especially as I have put quite a few on to my Kindle.</p>
    <p>I got interested in the idea of audio books a few years ago in conjunction with a daily walk. I found those books on Librivox and ended up recording my own voice as a volunteer reader rather than listening to books. I seem to have rediscovered it and also walking so want to maximise my reading by the use of audio books.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: </p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Get an adequate amount of sleep</p>
    <p>A lot goes on in our bodies when we sleep and that can't happen if we are awake. Part of my fun and indulgent lifestyle has been about staying up late playing games or watching TV series. But what I have found is that if I stay up later then I don't necessarily wake up much later. As with the comments I made about diet, I want sleep to be a support to my strength training (and for everything else for that matter) which means going to bed earlier and getting more sleep. During February I have been tracking my bedtimes and number of hours slept so that I have an idea of what is natural and use that as a starting point from which to work. Taking zinc has meant very vivid dreams which suggests REM sleep and hence better quality of sleep but quantity is also important.</p>
    <p>Reading before bed rather than watching something on the phone is a far better way to go off to sleep whereas watching something only creates more wakefulness or that feeling of being 'wired' and tired. Reaching for the phone is all too easy as it's right next to me along with a set of headphones. I can never stop at one video and before I know it 20-30 minutes have passed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Doing a free standing handstand for 10 seconds. Integrate a kettlebell routine into my regular program.</p>
    <p>Since discovering the works of Pavel Tsatsouline my ideas about strength training have changed a lot. I have started to write a separate post about it so I won't go into it too much here. The main thing is to implement some of those principles into my existing routine. I've bought myself a kettlebell and have started to learn how to use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Accuracy over speed. Smoother technique.</p>
          <p>I think that I'm at a point now where I don't really need to type any faster. My current speed of 60wpm is more than adequate for all the tasks that I perform. What does annoy me though is making mistakes. That is what really breaks my flow. I would happily type at 40 wpm but with no mistakes. I'm also finding that with the long reach needed on my right hand to my little finger I tend to lift off my whole hand and then it's hard to find my way back to the home row. My hand is large enough to be able to reach the backspace key and enter key without the index finger lifting from the notched j key. This also causes my shoulder to get tense on the right, so this is what I want to work on.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: 10k steps</p>
    <p>So far this year I've set a goal of walking 10k steps or more twice a week. I have been managing this quite comfortably but when I look at the steps for the week I see that on some days I don't walk at all. One of the reasons to do this was to try to make up for the lack of cycling this year but even 10k twice a week is miniscule compared to a ride. The effort is a lot lower and the heart rate remains low. I would really like to make it a daily goal rather than twice weekly but then it does take me 2 hours to walk that distance and would be a challenge on some days. 10k is quite an arbitrary number but all the same a mildly challenging one. Perhaps if I cycle that day then I don't need to walk as well in the same way that I don't practice yoga if I happen to be teaching that day.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Being present and focused without distraction.</p>
    <p>Since making the corpse part of my session it somehow makes it more of a yoga session rather than a stretching session. Doing some stretches in front of a screen has become a bit of a default as a means of getting myself to do something rather than nothing but I do want to wean myself off this because I know that I can have great sessions that are focused and more akin to how they were in my yoga heyday. I just need to breathe, set the timer and feel. I don't really have a particular posture or set of postures that I want to pursue. I don't want to go to a class, even though perhaps I should because I want to do it at home. I think the goal is more about maintenance with this one rather than progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Some of these are actual aims or intentions and others are options that I may or may not pursue. I want to use this also as a means of working my way through the 'someday / maybe' list and the items in my 'inbox' which often just get stuck in that list and don't get actioned.</p>

      <li>Get a blood test done</li>
      <li>Record audio books for Librivox</li>
      <li>Signing up to a work agency</li>

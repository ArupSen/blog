<p>Here are some guiding principles which I tend to use anyway but thought that it might be a good idea to make them more explicit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SMART goal setting</li>
  <li>Clarity and specificity</li>
  <li>80/20 thinking</li>
  <li>Factor in TV and gaming</li>
  <li>Make goals and targets shorter term - like the one paragraph goal</li>
  <li>Being focused while doing things - noticing preoccupations or distractions (could be main goal)</li>
  <li>What could be removed from my life</li>
  <li>Be very clear and precise about the task I am setting as well as the amount of time required</li>
  <li>Commitment: what can I commit to; what am I committed to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the goals for 2018. A lot of them are carried over from 2017 with a few additions. I didn't think through any particular new strategies as I had prior to the start of 2017 because they worked well and can also be carried over.</p>
<p>I want to try and keep the plan fairly short reading so that I don't feel that it's a burden to read each month.</p>
<p>The other thing that I want to do this year is to review every three months or so but that could be earlier or later depending on how I'm progressing. And rather than writing lengthy descriptions about the nature of the goals as I've done in previous years, this year I'm doing it more like a month plan, thinking of the year as a very long month. There is also the fact that this plan is being written after the year had started and goals for January and February were already in place: those goals will be influencing the year plan.</p>

    <p>Some of these are actual aims or intentions and others are options that I may or may not pursue. I want to use this also as a means of working my way through the 'someday / maybe' list and the items in my 'inbox' which often just get stuck in that list and don't get actioned.</p>

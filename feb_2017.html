<p>February has started and it begins with being ill. I haven't fully recovered from that heavy cold I had last month which means that I need to get better first before I can get back to things properly. This partly makes me step back from things and allows me to get some perspective but also makes me feel behind. As I said in the previous months report: one can't do much about being ill.</p>

  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Having enjoyed the contributing to GitHub short course so much I am going to look for a project GitHub where they welcome new contributors. I also want to learn about git itself, the command line and various programs available to the command line.</p>

  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>I'm almost done with Matt Haig's book, Reasons to Stay Alive and as I don't really have any recommendations or other books on my list I feel that it's time to get back to Dickens.</p>

  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I've been reading a bit about a ring training course called Rings One by Gold Medal Bodies. It seems to be the among the first that comes up when searching for gymnastic rings training. It's made for enthusiasts who don't want to train to be gymnasts but still want to benefit from training on the rings. I've read some good reviews about the program and even though it does cost money it's not too expensive at 100 USD. Having missed so many sessions in January due to illness I'm not going to start on a new program just yet but will first work on re-establishing my performance in my own program.</p>

    <p>I have a plan of going away for a few days in the latter part of February from the 20-22. I don't have an idea of where to go yet but certainly out of London if possible. I just want to have a short break and essentially get away from the day to day. Brighton seems to be the obvious choice but I haven't finalised anything as yet.</p>

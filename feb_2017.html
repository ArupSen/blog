<p>February has started and it begins with being ill. I haven't fully recovered from that heavy cold I had last month which means that I need to get better first before I can get back to things properly. This partly makes me step back from things and allows me to get some perspective but also makes me feel behind. As I said in the previous months report: one can't do much about being ill.</p>
<p>It's the 9th of the month as we enter into week two and even though I'm still getting better very slowly, I'm finding it hard to lower my expectations as per my goal for the year. It's not an easy one when you are in the habit of expecting a lot of yourself. I think I just need to keep it in mind.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>I had to pull out of a couple of meetings due to being poorly but it's also a move to gradually pull out of doing those extraneous activities outside of taking calls. The branch Twitter account is about to launch and we have had the go ahead from head office as well as the branch director's blessing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Having enjoyed the contributing to GitHub short course so much I am going to look for a project GitHub where they welcome new contributors. I also want to learn about git itself, the command line and various programs available to the command line.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>I'm almost done with Matt Haig's book, Reasons to Stay Alive and as I don't really have any recommendations or other books on my list I feel that it's time to get back to Dickens.</p>
    <p>Well and truly back into Martin Chuzzlewit and am enjoying it very much. As I've been travelling by public transport a lot recently I have had a bit more time to read too.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Junk food and comfort food has been the order of the day so far this month, today being the 9th. I've been physically ill which has also had an emotional counterpart in the form of a general sense of meaninglessness. As I've been gradually getting better and to counteract the emotional downturn comfort food has proven to be a winner. I'm not being too hard on myself about this as aside from playing videos games there isn't much else giving me pleasure right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I've been reading a bit about a ring training course called Rings One by Gold Medal Bodies. It seems to be the among the first that comes up when searching for gymnastic rings training. It's made for enthusiasts who don't want to train to be gymnasts but still want to benefit from training on the rings. I've read some good reviews about the program and even though it does cost money it's not too expensive at 100 USD. Having missed so many sessions in January due to illness I'm not going to start on a new program just yet but will first work on re-establishing my performance in my own program.</p>
    <p>Another week has gone by with no strength training. I'm OK with it, I think. I know that I need to get better first rather than keep up my training and risk getting worse.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>It's been a long time since I rode by bike. Today is the 9th and as far as I can remember, the last ride was on the 24th of January. That's not good is it?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Aside from missing the odd day here and there I seem to be doing well at discarding items on a day to day basis. I seem to forget that organising is also part of the goal but it rarely occurs to me even though the reminder does say "chuck or organise something".</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>I've missed quite a few sessions. I believe that in the first week of this month that aside from teaching my classes I didn't practice at all, not even my old method of doing the odd stretch while watching something. But then I haven't been well.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>I have a plan of going away for a few days in the latter part of February from the 20-22. I don't have an idea of where to go yet but certainly out of London if possible. I just want to have a short break and essentially get away from the day to day. Brighton seems to be the obvious choice but I haven't finalised anything as yet.</p>

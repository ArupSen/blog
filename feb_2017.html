<p>February has started and it begins with being ill. I haven't fully recovered from that heavy cold I had last month which means that I need to get better first before I can get back to things properly. This partly makes me step back from things and allows me to get some perspective but also makes me feel behind. As I said in the previous months report: one can't do much about being ill.</p>
<p>It's the 9th of the month as we enter into week two and even though I'm still getting better very slowly, I'm finding it hard to lower my expectations as per my goal for the year. It's not an easy one when you are in the habit of expecting a lot of yourself. I think I just need to keep it in mind.</p>
<p>It's a few days after my last update and things really do seem to have turned around. I am definitely out of the woods in terms of my illness, both physically and emotionally. As well as feeling weak and tired it also made me feel that everything was a bit pointless and that the pursuit of any activity was completely futile. I'm happy to say that this feeling has gradually drifted into the background (I'm not entirely sure if it has gone because it is something that I do experience every once in a while) and I am starting to feel excited about doing things again. I'm enjoying each of my goals and look forward to working on them.</p>
<p>Sick, sick, sick. I'm sick again. Congested sinuses, headache, tired and generally lacking in motivation to do anything. From the 13th to the 18th, which was yesterday I was just starting to get on my feet again, literally. But by Friday evening, essentially, the end of the week where the energy was coming back it sort of went again. I spent most of Saturday groaning and moaning and wanting only to be quiet. We did go out for a little bit. I read a lot. Maya wanted to go swimming but I just didn't have the energy to take her. When we were out at the park she told me that I should just try and ignore it, focus on other things and pretend it's not there. It sort of worked for while. We ate out at Subway, which I hate but she likes so we went. The food there is consistently awful. I don't think she goes there for the food but for the memory of going there once with a friend. We sat at the window table with the sun shining into our faces. We watched the passers by. We had to go to bed early because she was going on a Brownies trip the next day. I couldn't sleep; I was too hot and I had a headache. I sat in the sitting room and read for an hour.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>I had to pull out of a couple of meetings due to being poorly but it's also a move to gradually pull out of doing those extraneous activities outside of taking calls. The branch Twitter account is about to launch and we have had the go ahead from head office as well as the branch director's blessing.</p>
    <p>I have put together a Twitter team at our branch. We have been discussing how we will manage our account and each of us has read through the guidelines or Twitter Toolkit as it's called. We initially experienced some teething troubles setting up the account and then found that an account for our branch already existed! It was set up by a previous volunteer who left the branch back in 2013. By following some leads I tracked them down and found that the password still works. This meant that an initial set up process wasn't required and we could jump to the ongoing process instead: tweeting, following, re-tweeting, liking and so on and so forth. I'm very pleased about this because I want to step back from it and the fact that it's up and running and that I have two other team members who will eventually take over means that I can defer responsibility to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>I think I may have mentioned last month that having cold hands makes it harder to type but being tired or lethargic does the same thing. What I noticed was that I was achieving very poor speeds at the start of the session but slowly getting up to the 60wpm goal and often beyond. Surprisingly, even though I was ill I missed hardly any sessions and as a general rule tend to start my computing sessions with typing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Having enjoyed the contributing to GitHub short course so much I am going to look for a project GitHub where they welcome new contributors. I also want to learn about git itself, the command line and various programs available to the command line.</p>
    <p>I really want to get stuck into a Data Structures and Algorithms course but it would be quite involved. It would require me to leave other things alone and at the moment I don't really have time for that. I think that once I have pulled back from the many projects that I am pursuing I will feel able to commit myself. Till then it'll be more Git and command line and so on and so forth.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>I'm almost done with Matt Haig's book, Reasons to Stay Alive and as I don't really have any recommendations or other books on my list I feel that it's time to get back to Dickens.</p>
    <p>Well and truly back into Martin Chuzzlewit and am enjoying it very much. As I've been travelling by public transport a lot recently I have had a bit more time to read too.</p>
    <p>In addition to Martin Chuzzlewit I have added another book to my current reading list which is called Shoot the Damn Dog by Sally Brampton. It's about severe depression and was recommended by Samaritan colleague and follows on nicely after the Matt Haig book. I have made a start and am going to read it in parallel with the Dickens novel.</p>
    <p>How am I managing to read both books? Easy really, I read a chapter from one and then a chapter or two from the other. The Dickens chapters are quite long so only one from that book but then 2-3 from the Sally Brompton book.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Junk food and comfort food has been the order of the day so far this month, today being the 9th. I've been physically ill which has also had an emotional counterpart in the form of a general sense of meaninglessness. As I've been gradually getting better and to counteract the emotional downturn comfort food has proven to be a winner. I'm not being too hard on myself about this as aside from playing videos games there isn't much else giving me pleasure right now.</p>
    <p>Yes, junk food and more junk food but it's guilt free, which is nice.</p>
    <p>I only realised yesterday, the 18th, that I haven't given a thought to my Wednesday, healthy eating day. The final 2 Wednesdays in January were missed due to being ill but then for the first two Wednesdays in February it didn't even cross my mind. Wow, so no healthy eating? Well, at least I thought about it and it's the thought that counts.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I've been reading a bit about a ring training course called Rings One by Gold Medal Bodies. It seems to be the among the first that comes up when searching for gymnastic rings training. It's made for enthusiasts who don't want to train to be gymnasts but still want to benefit from training on the rings. I've read some good reviews about the program and even though it does cost money it's not too expensive at 100 USD. Having missed so many sessions in January due to illness I'm not going to start on a new program just yet but will first work on re-establishing my performance in my own program.</p>
    <p>Another week has gone by with no strength training. I'm OK with it, I think. I know that I need to get better first rather than keep up my training and risk getting worse.</p>
    <p>Last Friday, 10th February was my first proper strength training session, a cut down routine but I still went through all the exercises that I was doing before. I really enjoyed it and found that I had only lost a little strength. Today, the 13th, I did a longer session, still somewhat cut back doing only 2 sets rather than 3 but I was able to focus fully and put myself into each exercise. I noticed that there was a freshness which is only there after a period of rest. It's rare that I rest so much between workouts so in one sense it was good to have a longer break and it shows me that I don't need to worry about taking a week off now and again and that in fact it may actually help.</p>
    <p>So I missed Wednesday 15th due to receiving some potentially upsetting news. It caused me a good deal of anxiety and I phoned a friend and spoke to them for over an hour. I felt much better after the call but was in no state to do a workout, so I left it. But then on Friday 17th I did it and I'm now wondering if it had been too much and the reason why I was having what seemed like a relapse by the evening. The friend with whom I spoke said perhaps it wasn't the same cold but two or three different ones in succession. I felt fit enough or strong enough to perform a few exercises with Maya in the park on Saturday.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>It's been a long time since I rode by bike. Today is the 9th and as far as I can remember, the last ride was on the 24th of January. That's not good is it?</p>
    <p>On Saturday 11th, I got on the rollers. Illness or no illness, I haven't ridden the rollers in months and I had a great time. It's very cold at the moment and this was a good way to gradually get back into riding.</p>
    <p>I rode to Samaritans on the 14th, early morning, leaving the house at 06:20 and getting up at 05:30. I wondered if that was the main cause of my downfall. Only an hours ride in total but I really enjoyed it. It was cold but not freezing. Sunny and dry. I could feel how much fitness and strength I had lost. I rode again to and from Bayswater on Wednesday 15th. It felt hard going. It definitely took me longer than it usually does. On Thursday 16th I was riding once more, this time to my class in Knightsbridge. I really thought that my health was coming back but it seems that it wasn't.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Aside from missing the odd day here and there I seem to be doing well at discarding items on a day to day basis. I seem to forget that organising is also part of the goal but it rarely occurs to me even though the reminder does say "chuck or organise something".</p>
    <p>I'm starting to find it increasingly difficult to find things to throw away. I can't really count rubbish such as junk mail so I'm starting to notice those items that could possibly be sold, which I've kept back for that purpose.</p>
    <p>I missed a couple of days but I really can feel that it's getting harder now. So much has gone; stuff that I don't miss and don't think about but when I look at my shelves now I think that I would miss those things if they were gone. But would I really?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>I've missed quite a few sessions. I believe that in the first week of this month that aside from teaching my classes I didn't practice at all, not even my old method of doing the odd stretch while watching something. But then I haven't been well.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>I have a plan of going away for a few days in the latter part of February from the 20-22. I don't have an idea of where to go yet but certainly out of London if possible. I just want to have a short break and essentially get away from the day to day. Brighton seems to be the obvious choice but I haven't finalised anything as yet.</p>
    <p>This weekend, 11/12 of February I made a pasta sauce and I baked a banana loaf. It showed me that my energy is coming back and that I'm feeling inspired again.</p>
    <p>Does eating at Subway count as eating out at a restaurant? Didn't occur to me at the time and I felt stingy and tried to avoid it. I did do some more cooking though. I made the tomato and garlic rice in the Madhur Jaffrey book that I've borrowed from my friend Luke. I also made a dipping sauce on Friday to go with my fasting supper. This was made from yoghurt with some added ground roasted cumin seeds and salt. Great dip for boiled green beans. Went nicely with hard boiled eggs too. How come I had the yoghurt? Well, it was because I made black-eyed bean curry on Tuesday night also from the Madhur Jaffrey book.</p>
    <p>I thought about earning more money. I'm part of the Racer Rosa shop team in Walthamstow but so far, after almost 5 months it's not really working for me and I have lost around half of what I have put into it. My stake or my contribution to the rent has been &pound250.00 a month. The idea was that it would be a platform for me to launch and promote my North London wheel building business but I've realised that I would need a fair amount of clients to just break even not to mention the time required to do the work. It's not something that I want to do that much so from the end of March I'm going to be changing my relationship to the shop. This isn't making money as such but at least cutting costs that I can't cover.</p>
    <p>I also made a couple more cost cutting moves. One of which was to cancel the milk from the local milkman. It's delivered by Milk & More and even though it's expensive at 95p a pint, I do love the nostalgia of it. But it seems to go sour too quickly and lately one or two deliveries have been missed. They were enough to cause me to stop it. For one pound I can get 4 pints at Tesco. But I don't need 4 pints. What I've been doing is getting a 2 pint plastic bottle for 80p once or twice a week. I'm not sure how much I'm saving but at least I've taken away an ongoing cost. The other ongoing cost was my mobile phone bill. My two year contract ended at the end of January and so I contacted EE my provider and asked them what I should do. After some online chatting which took the best part of an hour I got my monthly bill halved as I have paid for the phone now but at the same time I'm fairly happy with the call plan that I have. So the phone and the milk together will save me about &pound25.00 a month.</p>
    <p>But what about getting more work? I've had a web contract that started in late December last year but for various reasons I didn't make a real start on it till around the 16th of February. If this is the reality of my situation then it makes me wonder when I would actually do any more work, web development work, even if I did manage to get more on a regular basis. I must say though that I have had other web development jobs but did manage to complete those ones. They were much smaller though and easier to complete. I've thought a lot about what and how I can make more money especially while considering my stake in the shop and without disrupting my lifestyle what I've come up with is to do a bit more of what I'm doing now: one more private yoga class (I don't really fancy a regular group class), one more wheel order per week and some sort of regular web or other development work. This would more than adequately cover my costs and give me a little extra.</p>

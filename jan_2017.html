<p>It's halfway through the first month of 2017 and I can happily say that I feel that I'm doing rather well. I don't have that sense of the year running away and madly trying to catch up. I have lowered my expectations and have made my goals less challenging which seems to have reduced the fear of failure already and has encouraged me to pursue all of them to the level that I have set and even to surpass that level.</p>
<p>Since I bought myself a new graphics card as a Xmas present to myself, I have been gaming a great deal. This month in particular I have been playing a game called Mad Max, based on the movie series. I bought this game in the Steam winter sale and have been playing most days till around 02:00. It has meant that I have been putting leisure before other activities as well as rising after 09:00 and generally feeling more tired than I otherwise would. It's as though I'm trying to prolong the Xmas period.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>I've been mentoring a new volunteer which means taking on extra duties to accommodate them. It seems that our branch (Croydon) is actually growing in the number of regular volunteers as we are looking at adding a new shift to our weekly rota. I've also been working towards getting the branch eBay account up and running as well as a branch Twitter account.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>I'm getting way more than my twice a week goal and have been very close to the 60 wpm mark and often around 62. This has been very inspiring and showing me that with just a little extra effort it really is possible to make progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>As 2016 came to a close I developed an interest in reviewing my command line skills and also take them a bit further. I've been continuing with that and as with the typing have been doing a small amount each week. It's been fun so far but the best part is not having to try to achieve a 20 hour a week quota.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>20 minutes a day has been my goal and so far I seem to have done that. It's hard to let of go of previous goals and expectations though and I still feel as though I should be trying to get a quota for the day or aim to finish the book by the month. I'm still reading Tender is the Night which I started in December and enjoying in very much. Rather than stop to look up new words I have been bookmarking the pages on my Kindle. The plan is to go back and look them up again when I've completed the book and then add them to my flashcards program, Anki.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>So far I've had 2 healthy eating days. The first one seemed to come suddenly as it was the 4th of January but I managed not to eat chips. The 2nd one on the 11th was also easy because during that week I had been having stomach problems so I was off my food anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Week one went really well and it was pretty much a carry over from last year but in week two having had stomach cramps on the Sunday which didn't fully abate till the Wednesday, I missed 2 sessions and did a shorter one on the Friday.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>I've been riding very little and even taking public transport to commute: quite a contrast when you consider the amount of cycling I was doing last year. But during the final few months of 2016 I was losing interest in cycling and even though I know that it hasn't totally gone it certainly hasn't come back as yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Chuck something or organise something every day. Aside from 2 days I've been doing this consistently and I'm actually achieving what I wanted to achieve last year. Sometimes the items are very small such as an old toothbrush. Last year my intention would have been to chuck that old toothbrush out but would have said to myself that it was too small an item and then decided to pick on something larger. Because on it's own it didn't seem to make a significant impact on the amount of clutter as a whole I didn't do it but over the course of the year that means 365 toothbrushes could have been thrown out but weren't. I've made a spreadsheet on Google Drive and have been keeping a record. It's getting me to plan ahead as well: what will I chuck tomorrow? I've even managed to put something on eBay.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>The focused sessions where I am without a screen seem to be actually taking place. I have been using my timer to stay in postures for one minute and other than missing a few days partly due to neglect and also due to illness, I feel pretty good about the new regime. On one occasion I did listen to a podcast but with the screen itself turned off to stop me looking at it. Even when there is nothing on the screen I still seem to look at it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Out of my one-off goals I have been cooking. I've been taking the time to look up recipes and take my time with meal preparation. I wouldn't say that I have been doing this for all meals, especially as it's winter and the kitchen with no heating is cold. But hunting down fresh curry leaves on the streets of Croydon does make me feel that I care about my cooking.</p>

<p>It's halfway through the first month of 2017 and I can happily say that I feel that I'm doing rather well. I don't have that sense of the year running away and madly trying to catch up. I have lowered my expectations and have made my goals less challenging which seems to have reduced the fear of failure already and has encouraged me to pursue all of them to the level that I have set and even to surpass that level.</p>
<p>Since I bought myself a new graphics card as a Xmas present to myself, I have been gaming a great deal. This month in particular I have been playing a game called Mad Max, based on the movie series. I bought this game in the Steam winter sale and have been playing most days till around 02:00. It has meant that I have been putting leisure before other activities as well as rising after 09:00 and generally feeling more tired than I otherwise would. It's as though I'm trying to prolong the Xmas period.</p>
<p>More gaming during the third week and more avoiding of what I need to get done but as well as being distracted I am focused enough to manage that distraction. What I've been doing is to prioritise the most urgent things and then contact persons concerned to get extensions. So far, they don't seem to mind but it makes me feel lazy and unprofessional. Well, it's either that or simply ignore them which would be a whole lot worse. The main thing that I have been putting off is the Tax Return, which I was hoping to start in December: it was a good plan that wasn't executed.</p>
<p>January is now over and it's 1st February today. From the 24th of the month, the final week, I came down with a very heavy cold. It was so debilitating that I simply had to put everything on hold. I really struggled. I wanted to cancel everything but didn't. I had committed myself to my classes and my Samaritan duties so even though I was suffering I still went along to them. This was a mistake and it meant that I couldn't recover as quickly as I would have had I simply rested. On the Friday of that week I had to miss seeing Maya as I was way too tired to leave the house. As I mentioned, today is the 1st of February and it's a Wednesday and even though I feel better it's not a whole lot better.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>I've been mentoring a new volunteer which means taking on extra duties to accommodate them. It seems that our branch (Croydon) is actually growing in the number of regular volunteers as we are looking at adding a new shift to our weekly rota. I've also been working towards getting the branch eBay account up and running as well as a branch Twitter account.</p>
    <p>I have been finding that these extra things that I have been doing a little bit overwhelming on top of my listening duties. I think that once the eBay and Twitter accounts are up and running with someone to keep them running, I will step back from these things and focus my efforts on taking calls only, at least for a while.</p>
    <p>My mentee has completed all of her duties with me and I'm proud to say that she is well on her way to becoming a member of our branch, taking calls via SMS, phone and email. But after this one I won't be taking another mentee for a little while. Mentoring someone is very rewarding but you do end up taking on extra duties and work on top of your regular ones. I did this one immediately following another one, my first because there were a lot of mentees that required mentors and would not have been able to go through to the next stage otherwise. But now I need to focus on my own interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>I'm getting way more than my twice a week goal and have been very close to the 60 wpm mark and often around 62. This has been very inspiring and showing me that with just a little extra effort it really is possible to make progress.</p>
    <p>I noticed that when my hands are cold it's a lot harder so I tend to factor that in. Obviously I missed a few days due to illness but not as many as I would have expected. Still going quite well and I'm happy with the progress.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>As 2016 came to a close I developed an interest in reviewing my command line skills and also take them a bit further. I've been continuing with that and as with the typing have been doing a small amount each week. It's been fun so far but the best part is not having to try to achieve a 20 hour a week quota.</p>
    <p>I haven't been keeping track of the number of hours that I have been doing it but I certainly have been doing a lot more than the 2 hours a week that I have set for myself. This month I have learned or at least gone over my command line skills, reviewed git and Github and have learned about online collaboration. It seems that more and more projects are on Github nowadays so it makes sense to know how to contribute to a project that is hosted on that platform. I've just finished a short course by egghead-io covering this topic and they even have a dummy project where you can contribute and get used to the process. It sort of allows you to just keep doing what you're doing but in conjunction with a real person. In the back of my mind I'm thinking that this could lead to actual paid work but I don't want to think too much about that and put pressure on myself when I'm actually having some fun. Git, Vim, Github, Node, npm, TDD and so on and so forth, all the cool stuff that is current. Feels way cool.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>20 minutes a day has been my goal and so far I seem to have done that. It's hard to let of go of previous goals and expectations though and I still feel as though I should be trying to get a quota for the day or aim to finish the book by the month. I'm still reading Tender is the Night which I started in December and enjoying in very much. Rather than stop to look up new words I have been bookmarking the pages on my Kindle. The plan is to go back and look them up again when I've completed the book and then add them to my flashcards program, Anki.</p>
    <p>I've finished Tender is the Night (23rd) and have now started Reasons to Stay Alive. Now that I'm writing this I can see that I had the intention to write up the new words but can feel my body going limp at the idea and thinking of it as a chore.</p>
    <p>I've been really enjoying Reasons to Stay Alive and am more than 3/4 of the way through it. I have been reading more than the 20 minutes that I have committed to it each day especially as I haven't been cycling much lately due to cold weather and illness so have been taking the opportunity to read a bit more. I've been slowing down rather than trying to actively read faster. Doing the speed reading exercises makes you feel as though you should be always trying to increase your reading speed but that only takes away my joy of reading and entering into the space that the author is trying to conjure in your mind. I have been playing a video game called Mad Max and in it he sometimes finds what is known in the game as a History Relic. It's often a photo or postcard with something hand written on the reverse. Once you have completed your examination of the item Max will often make a comment. I have subtitles enables so I can see what he is about to say before he says it but it's not in any way like one would read a line from a book; he says it with a lot of depth and meaning and often very slowly with a pause between the phrases, probably for dramatic effect. This has really influenced my reading and I now speed up or slow down according to what I believe the narrator demands. It somehow makes the passage more real, more significant and more often than not a good deal more engaging. One of the things that I've realised with these video games is that once I'm engaged in that world I don't really want to finish the game and leave it. It's should be the same with a book especially when it's rich and delicately crafted.</p>

  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>So far I've had 2 healthy eating days. The first one seemed to come suddenly as it was the 4th of January but I managed not to eat chips. The 2nd one on the 11th was also easy because during that week I had been having stomach problems so I was off my food anyway.</p>
    <p>For the final two Wednesdays I was ill and needed my comfort food and it didn't even occur to me to be healthy. The intention is sort of still there but when you're ill and ravenous, the thought of removing the one thing that will give some semblance of pleasure really does amount to self-torture.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Week one went really well and it was pretty much a carry over from last year but in week two having had stomach cramps on the Sunday which didn't fully abate till the Wednesday, I missed 2 sessions and did a shorter one on the Friday.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday 26th I did my workout even though I had been ill. I had a good workout but probably paid the price the next day. I missed it that Friday and then the following Monday and Wednesday too. It's a little bit annoying but you can't really do that much about being ill. I don't want to impede my recovery by trying to exercise intensely when I should probably be resting.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>I've been riding very little and even taking public transport to commute: quite a contrast when you consider the amount of cycling I was doing last year. But during the final few months of 2016 I was losing interest in cycling and even though I know that it hasn't totally gone it certainly hasn't come back as yet.</p>
    <p>The last time I rode my bike was the 14th and today is the 23rd. It's cold and I can feel a bit of sniffle but I will ride nevertheless. It's been too long.</p>
    <p>I rode on the 24th and that was the last time, so another 10 days have passed. It's been a bad month for cycling. I also still haven't decided on whether I'm going to be riding LEL or any plans to ride Audax this year. I can feel that I'm going leave it to one side till the warmer weather comes along.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Chuck something or organise something every day. Aside from 2 days I've been doing this consistently and I'm actually achieving what I wanted to achieve last year. Sometimes the items are very small such as an old toothbrush. Last year my intention would have been to chuck that old toothbrush out but would have said to myself that it was too small an item and then decided to pick on something larger. Because on it's own it didn't seem to make a significant impact on the amount of clutter as a whole I didn't do it but over the course of the year that means 365 toothbrushes could have been thrown out but weren't. I've made a spreadsheet on Google Drive and have been keeping a record. It's getting me to plan ahead as well: what will I chuck tomorrow? I've even managed to put something on eBay.</p>
    <p>The daily practice of throwing something out has been a good one and other than a few days missed, I've managed to stick to it. I've sold something on eBay but it took me a while to package it and take it along to the Post Office.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>The focused sessions where I am without a screen seem to be actually taking place. I have been using my timer to stay in postures for one minute and other than missing a few days partly due to neglect and also due to illness, I feel pretty good about the new regime. On one occasion I did listen to a podcast but with the screen itself turned off to stop me looking at it. Even when there is nothing on the screen I still seem to look at it.</p>
    <p>More missed sessions in week 3 which has been a little bit disappointing but at the same time I am confident that things will pick up again soon.</p>
    <p>OK, so yet more missed sessions due to being ill but even though I am a little bit annoyed with myself it can't be helped when you're ill. I know that I have had some bad years with my yoga and managed to come back so I'm not too worried about losing my practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Out of my one-off goals I have been cooking. I've been taking the time to look up recipes and take my time with meal preparation. I wouldn't say that I have been doing this for all meals, especially as it's winter and the kitchen with no heating is cold. But hunting down fresh curry leaves on the streets of Croydon does make me feel that I care about my cooking.</p>
    <p>I baked a banana and walnut loaf cake from a recipe given to me by my yoga students. Really enjoying my baking especially as it's an area of cooking where I have little experience and it's also something that I can do with Maya.</p>

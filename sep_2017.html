<p>I'm starting off September on schedule having had a good break towards the end of August and a chance to sit down and spend some time thinking about my goals and how I want to pursue them. Since the move to this new place in May I've been often wondering what I'm doing (as an overall life ambition) and whether anything is even worth the effort. This leads me to the conclusion that I don't really know what I want. But that statement is only true for that context: career / life direction. But in fact there are things that I want. They may not be life changing or great upheavals but I do actually want them and therefore I will spend time and effort achieving them.</p>
<p>When I say that it's all the same thing over and over again, having a stable base and a regular routine are essential to pursuing any ongoing goal such as yoga, strength traning and a good diet. If I lived a life where I was travelling a lot for example or moved home every 18 months, it might be exciting and give a sense that something was happening but it wouldn't give that stablity and foundation to act as a platform where I can build the practices that I have. I've already noticed how working in Walthamstow has interrupted my routines but I'm going to be taking steps to rearrange some things which may help.</p>

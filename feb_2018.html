<p>February 2018 is essentially a continuation from January with only some small changes. Even though I still haven't written the year plan for this year January went rather well so I'm riding on that wave and have set up February accordingly. I am tracking a few goals daily, namely Sleep, Diet and Meditation on a Google sheet. Just to gather data which might help me to set goals for March.</p>
<p>One thing that did confuse me when I had set a goal that was defined as 2-3 times a week was when exactly was a week? Would it start on a Sunday or a Monday? Years ago I used to start my week on Sundays because it was a working day. But now it's a Monday. What happens when a week is made up of the end of one month and the start of another? If the goal of the previous month is carried over then those 2 months are like one long month but otherwise I suppose there would have to be an overlap.</p>
<p>Halfway into week 1 and about a week into February itself and I seem to be doing pretty well. I have a lot of new goals but essentially it's about keeping track this month. Things like making a note of when I meditated or when I went to bed etc.</p>
<p>At the end of week 1 on the 11th I seem to have been looking at my goals and thinking about them a lot. Whenever I am at a loose end I look at the list or the reminders that come up on my phone. I do have a lot of things to log so I seem to be holding them in my head but it's only for a month. I am a little concerned that I still haven't written the year plan: I don't want to be at the end of February by the time it is completed but then I do have a plan for this month so it doesn't matter so much.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Get shot of DVDs. Clear out cupboard in sitting room. Sell the bike work stand.</p>
    <p>I've given my list of DVD movies and TV series that I have to friends and am waiting to see if there are any that they might want. I'll leave this open till the middle of the month and then it will be time to finally discard them after having them for 9 years or thereabouts with little or no use.</p>
    <p>I have tidied and re-arranged the cupboard. All the packing boxes are now at the top as they don't need to be accessed. There were also a load of tupperware boxes in a black plastic bag that was taking up a lot of space as well as plastic sheeting that I use for protecting the floor when I'm painting. There were also a load of tupperware boxes in a black plastic bag that was taking up a lot of space as well as plastic sheeting that I use for protecting the floor when I'm painting. But the main thing that was using up the space in that cupboard were items that I have been planning to sell or throw away but the fact that they are in there meant that they tend to get forgotten so I've taken them out. Now they are cluttering up the place and in view so that might actually encourage me to sell them more quickly.</p>

  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Ride a little or ride a lot but ride.</p>
    <p>The first seven days have not managed to get me on the bike. The back tyre is flat and after my knees got better that is the excuse that I've been giving myself to stay off it. Do I even care about riding? It's a question that I think I should sit down and consider.</p>
    <p>Well, I fixed the flat but I still didn't ride. Not feeling it at all so not pushing myself to do it. Does feel strange though as it was something that used to get me excited and occupied a lot of my time.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep track of food (calories) consumed on MyFitnessPal. Continue taking zinc.</p>
    <p>It has been interesting to see how many calories are contained in the foods that I eat without thinking about it. The MyFitnessPal app also gives warnings of too much saturated fat and too much sugar which can cause alarm but then that isn't my goal but only to keep track. I've also been weighing myself because my belly looks to be a bit bigger than usual and I tell myself that it's more muscle underneath but that probably isn't the case. One of my goals for the year is to get ripped, well it's on my list of ideas for the year as I haven't finished the year plan yet but still, it's there in the back of my mind.</p>
    <p>On the 6th I ate a lot of sugar (well, the weekend too because I made biscuits). On my way to the shop (Racer Rosa) I bought two packets from Poundland and while I was building wheels I snacked on them. After a while I wasn't even enjoying them much any more but continued to eat them. I logged the calories using the barcode search feature in MyFitnessPal and saw that even though I had only eaten two thirds of each packet I had already consumed close to a thousand calories. In the evening after telling friends that I had done this earlier in the day gave rise to cravings for more. I ended up going out to buy a back of caramel shortbreads and eating them all. Now my calories were way over the amount that I needed for the day and I didn't sleep well as a result. I could feel it in my stomach and I could feel what I thought of as the sugar through my body. The next day I had a reaction to this and decided to snack on higher protein foods and the urge took me out to buy lots of eggs. I wonder if this will last.</p>
    <p>I'm still into the tracking and I'm leaning towards more protein as one day I opted for chicken skewers instead of cake and on another occasion I got cocktail sausages instead of some sort of carb loaded snack. I've also been loading up on green vegetables such as celery, brussel sprouts, leaks etc. But there is no real stipulation other than to keep track this month.</p>

  <li><h4>Guitar</h4>
    <p>Goals: Play on two Sunday evenings and one weekday. Retreive acoustic classical.</p>
    <p>It's the 2nd Sunday and I still haven't played but there is still time. I have however got in contact with my friend who I haven't seen in a long while and asked if he still has the classical. He said that he does still have it and that I can have it back at some point.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sit for 5 minutes every day. Keep a log of time of day.</p>
    <p>On average during the first week it has been 10 minutes or more.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work on mastering command line guides &amp; bash scripting.</p>
    <p>Over the first weekend, the 3rd and the 4th I went through my hard drives (one of my one-off goals for the month) and used primarily the command line to work my way through the contents. I moved movies that my daughter used to have when she had an account on my computer on to her laptop using rsync. Also changing permissions, ownerships and finding my way round all of this using the man pages rather than doing Google searches. This was very satisfying and gave me a sense that a lot can be achieved using the command line and that I'm not as much of a noob as I think I am.</p>
    <p>On the 5th, the Monday, a client of mine came to me with a MacBook Pro which had been malfunctioning. He had even taken it to the Apple store where they had informed him that the graphics hardware needed to be replaced. Faced with an expensive repair job that could possibly make the machine inoperable his first concern was to make sure that his data was backed up. I removed the hard drive and applied all that I had learned over the weekend about permissions and rsync and was able to copy all of his important (and not so important) data to an external portable hard drive that he had brought. We found a possible way to save the laptop without any major surgery and that would involve booting it with Arch Linux and getting the machine to use the built-in graphics hardware rather than the add-on. It involved using the command line for nearly the whole process and I learned how to create a bootloader using the dd command. I was successful in my attempt to revive the machine which was extremely rewarding and it made me feel that the study that I have been doing was very worthwhile and one of the main reasons why I was able to achieve the success that I did.</p>

  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Finish Bleak House and read Power to the People. Commit to a reading day.</p>
    <p>I've set a reading day for the 25th which is a Sunday following a twilight shift at Samaritans. When I set it in my calendar I was thinking of it as an optional reading day but now that I look at my goal I see the word commit. That scares me a little. But commit means commit.</p>
    <p>I was thinking about another possible reading day, today on the 11th but as I wanted to swap my strength training session to today from Monday and do some other things such as this I decided to leave it till the 25th. Who knows, I may have finished the book by then.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do a shift at Waltham Forest. Tweet on Mondays.</p>
    <p>It's Wednesday the 7th and I haven't tweeted for my branch.</p>
    <p>Well, I have my reminder to tweet set for next week and yesterday I conducted yet another peer review at my branch for one of my colleagues. The quality of service that we provide is still impeccable.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep track of bedtime &amp; sleep hours along with any notes.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I sleep a little and sometimes I sleep a lot but by the end of the month I'll have some real figures. What I'll make of them I don't know but I'm still collecting data for now.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do at least one extra hand stand session &amp; pull up GTG. Grippers. Limbering up first thing.</p>
    <p>The limbering up first thing is great. It only takes me about 5 minutes or less but really sets me up for the morning pages, especially stretching the hands.</p>
    <p>Using Pavel's ideas is making my training sessions much more enjoyable. I'm a lot more absorbed in how my body is working in terms of whether all the muscles are tightening, such as my butt. During my second session in week 1 on the 7th of February, I did pull-ups with the vacuum cleaner strapped around my waist. I got three very strict reps out but didn't attempt a fourth because he says that you shouldn't really be working to failure. In the past that would have made me feel that I was slacking off but thinking that I'm working to build my strength rather than my size I don't mind. I do sort of want to get bigger but really I want to be stronger without necessarily getting bigger. I also only did two sets.</p>
    <p>More reps on the pull-ups with the vacuum cleaner attached and on Saturday 10th I bought a kettle bell. I've been dipping into a book called Enter the Kettle Bell also by Pavel I got a 16kg cast iron one from Argos which I then carried home on the bus; felt like carrying a small but compact suitcase.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Twice weekly Typescout and once alphabet exercise.</p>
      <p>I tried the alphabet exercise but found it to be much harder than I thought. You have to the alphabet from a to z without making a mistake. If you do make a mistake then you simply start again on the next line. I managed to get three lines in a row but that was my best. Wow, this was a real eye opener. I'll definitely be trying this one again.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: 10k steps twice a week.</p>
    <p>I surpassed the 10k on Friday and walked in excess of 14k but on the other days I was lower than the 10k. I had an idea of instead making the goal 20k for the whole week. Nah, that's no challenge.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Always do corpse. Create one long and one short session.</p>
    <p>I have been doing my practice and I have been using the timer as well as doing the corpse at the end of the session but I seem to have forgotten all about making routines. Time to get out a paper and pen.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Buy shoes. Take a cold shower. Set reminders for hosting clients. Read about peer to peer lending. Set up spoke cutting page. Complete year plan. Think about what could be removed from my life. Complete the hard drive audit.</p>
    <p>During the first weekend I did the hard drive audit. It was very enjoyable to browse them via the command line and move some things around. The plan was to move things on to fewer discs and then discard the rest it's not easy. I did manage to destroy one drive which was a lot of fun. They only sell for pennies on eBay. I've also set up reminders to remind my hosting clients that they need to renew.</p>
    <p>On the morning of Saturday 10th I took a cold shower. I didn't fully put myself under the water but managed to get my arms and legs there. When it came to torso that was another matter. It certainly was invigorating and I'm keen to try again, this time going fully under the water with my whole body.</p>

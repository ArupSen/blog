<p>February 2018 is essentially a continuation from January with only some small changes. Even though I still haven't written the year plan for this year January went rather well so I'm riding on that wave and have set up February accordingly. I am tracking a few goals daily, namely Sleep, Diet and Meditation on a Google sheet. Just to gather data which might help me to set goals for March.</p>
<p>One thing that did confuse me when I had set a goal that was defined as 2-3 times a week was when exactly was a week? Would it start on a Sunday or a Monday? Years ago I used to start my week on Sundays because it was a working day. But now it's a Monday. What happens when a week is made up of the end of one month and the start of another? If the goal of the previous month is carried over then those 2 months are like one long month but otherwise I suppose there would have to be an overlap.</p>
<p>Halfway into week 1 and about a week into February itself and I seem to be doing pretty well. I have a lot of new goals but essentially it's about keeping track this month. Things like making a note of when I meditated or when I went to bed etc.</p>
<p>At the end of week 1 on the 11th I seem to have been looking at my goals and thinking about them a lot. Whenever I am at a loose end I look at the list or the reminders that come up on my phone. I do have a lot of things to log so I seem to be holding them in my head but it's only for a month. I am a little concerned that I still haven't written the year plan: I don't want to be at the end of February by the time it is completed but then I do have a plan for this month so it doesn't matter so much.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14th of February, Valentine's Day and halfway through the month. Kind of feels as though the month has only just started and that I don't have much spare time to get on with these goals. I took on an extra yoga class this week and had my daughter on Monday it being half-term holidays so I feel that I don't have the usual amount of leisure time that I enjoy.</p>
<p>So here we are at Monday the 19th and reviewing the latter half of the previous week. By the end of the weekend I noticed that I wasn't quite so engaged with my goals as I was at the start of the month. In a way this is a good thing because I didn't want to get under the false impression that I would be able to sustain that level of enthusiasm for the entire month. However, that is only how I felt, what I actually did was very different. Even though I had a full weekend with my daughter I still managed not to neglect some of those small things such as writing down what I ate, tracking my bedtimes and doing the odd pull-up. So even though I felt as though I wasn't winning I was indeed doing so. I think that is a sign of discipline or habit over motivation. I just need to go through that struggle of pushing through that barrier until it starts to get done without me thinking about it.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about the things that could be removed from my life during the past week in order to free up my time and my head space. Some of the new goals that I've added this year such as guitar and meditation although have good intentions haven't really whetted my appetite that much and the idea of doing them is more like a chore than something that I look forward to. There is a difference between wanting to do something and wanting to get something done. Many of the things that get added to my list of ideas are things that I'd like to get done and at the time that I added them to the list there was a burst of enthusiasm but a burst is all it was. Rather than completely remove it from my goals what I'm going to do is to put it on pause, a mini sabbatical if you like. During that time I am of course more than welcome to pursue that goal should I so choose but it allows me to assess the level of engagement with it.</p>
<p>February has been very much a month of logging and keeping track of many things such as sleep, meditation and food intake. But by the end of the month it started to feel very normal and just goes to show how little time is required to make a habit change. Even though it seemed like a lot to be carrying in my head I did enjoy February and look forward to taking some of the things that I learned into the next month.</p>

  <li><h4>Clutter</h4>
    <p>Goals: Get shot of DVDs. Clear out cupboard in sitting room. Sell the bike work stand.</p>
    <p>I've given my list of DVD movies and TV series that I have to friends and am waiting to see if there are any that they might want. I'll leave this open till the middle of the month and then it will be time to finally discard them after having them for 9 years or thereabouts with little or no use.</p>
    <p>I have tidied and re-arranged the cupboard. All the packing boxes are now at the top as they don't need to be accessed. There were also a load of tupperware boxes in a black plastic bag that was taking up a lot of space as well as plastic sheeting that I use for protecting the floor when I'm painting. But the main thing that was using up the space in that cupboard were items that I have been planning to sell or throw away but the fact that they are in there meant that they tend to get forgotten so I've taken them out. Now they are cluttering up the place and in view so that might actually encourage me to sell them more quickly.</p>
    <p>I've posted the map holder that I sold on ebay on Monday 12th so that means one more unused item is now gone from my life. Still waiting for some friends to come back to me about the DVD's that they might want before I throw them all out. I've removed the bike work stand from under my bed ready for photographs and then posting on eBay.</p>
    <p>The plan was to add items on eBay this (17/18) weekend but I didn't. I've pulled out the work stand from under the bed but because I don't want to sell it as collection only which would fetch less money than if I were to deliver it I have been hesitating. Well, the month isn't over yet.</p>
    <p>On Monday 19th I finally received the list of DVDs that a friend wanted and it was good number but still hundreds remain. I now no longer have any excuse to keep them.</p>
    <p>During the final weekend of the month I got around to putting the bike work stand on eBay. I suppose I've been reluctant to sell it because I imagined using it again and I also thought that without being able to pack it up I wouldn't be able to fetch much for it but having seen someone sell one for a good price as collection only I have decided to do the same.</p>
    <p>The bike work stand got a great deal of attention in spite of it being collection only and in the end fetched a lot more than I had anticipated. It was collected the very next day following the end of the auction. It's gone!</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Goals: Ride a little or ride a lot but ride.</p>
    <p>The first seven days have not managed to get me on the bike. The back tyre is flat and after my knees got better that is the excuse that I've been giving myself to stay off it. Do I even care about riding? It's a question that I think I should sit down and consider.</p>
    <p>Well, I fixed the flat but I still didn't ride. Not feeling it at all so not pushing myself to do it. Does feel strange though as it was something that used to get me excited and occupied a lot of my time.</p>
    <p>A friend of mine asked if I wanted to ride on Sunday (18) but told him that I had my daughter with me. I told him also that my connection with cycling was fading and he found that very disturbing, something precious that one shouldn't discard so lightly. His words made an impact upon me because they did make sense and perhaps my connection only felt that it was fading but in reality it wasn't. But the urge wasn't there so why should I push it?</p>
    <p>I walk past the bikes in my hallway and sometimes I don't even notice them. Other times I notice a faint glimmer of sadness that they are gathering dust and cobwebs. I'm pretty sure they will stay there the rest of the week.</p>
    <p>Only 2 more days left of the month and my arse has not touched the saddle. Is cycling no longer a part of my life?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep track of food (calories) consumed on MyFitnessPal. Continue taking zinc.</p>
    <p>It has been interesting to see how many calories are contained in the foods that I eat without thinking about it. The MyFitnessPal app also gives warnings of too much saturated fat and too much sugar which can cause alarm but then that isn't my goal but only to keep track. I've also been weighing myself because my belly looks to be a bit bigger than usual and I tell myself that it's more muscle underneath but that probably isn't the case. One of my goals for the year is to get ripped, well it's on my list of ideas for the year as I haven't finished the year plan yet but still, it's there in the back of my mind.</p>
    <p>On the 6th I ate a lot of sugar (well, the weekend too because I made biscuits). On my way to the shop (Racer Rosa) I bought two packets from Poundland and while I was building wheels I snacked on them. After a while I wasn't even enjoying them much any more but continued to eat them. I logged the calories using the barcode search feature in MyFitnessPal and saw that even though I had only eaten two thirds of each packet I had already consumed close to a thousand calories. In the evening after telling friends that I had done this earlier in the day gave rise to cravings for more. I ended up going out to buy a back of caramel shortbreads and eating them all. Now my calories were way over the amount that I needed for the day and I didn't sleep well as a result. I could feel it in my stomach and I could feel what I thought of as the sugar through my body. The next day I had a reaction to this and decided to snack on higher protein foods and the urge took me out to buy lots of eggs. I wonder if this will last.</p>
    <p>I'm still into the tracking and I'm leaning towards more protein as one day I opted for chicken skewers instead of cake and on another occasion I got cocktail sausages instead of some sort of carb loaded snack. I've also been loading up on green vegetables such as celery, brussel sprouts, leaks etc. But there is no real stipulation other than to keep track this month.</p>
    <p>I watched a video on YouTube by Elliot Hulse where he gives a very bare bones formula for removing belly fat forever and having a healthy life. He essentially says that you should eat 'clean'. Drink only water, no soft drinks, walk every day and lots of fresh vegetables and lean protein. Do weight training of some kind and that was about it. I realised that it was the video that got me started on Librivox a few years ago because he mentioned that during his walks he was listening to audio books and getting smarter while he walked. I did it for a month or so but that was all. On Sunday (18) I wanted a greasy fry up and decided to go to the shops and get some bacon as I already had lots of eggs. I also got beef for later in the day. Two eggs, two rashers of bacon and mushrooms. Fried in coconut oil but without any preservatives etc and with no sugar. For lunch I had more bacon with celery and the rest of the mushrooms and then for dinner I had beef stew with red cabbage. I really enjoyed it and I didn't feel hungry. Could be a phase or could be the start of eating 'clean' as a regime. It goes without saying that I kept track of all this and noticed that even though I imagined that the calories would be high, they were in fact quite low.</p>
    <p>I seem to have jumped on the clean eating plan without a real plan as such. I've written down some ideas that I want to implement next month such as eating more protein, eating clean and drinking more water etc. but I seem to be making a head start. The fact that I've put on a few kgs over what I'd like to be and far above where I was when I first stated the fasting diet shows me that the indulgence in junk food has really taken it's toll and even though it's only for 5 days of the week, it's still enough to put on weight. On Tuesday 20th I ate pretty clean all day aside from some crackers and have planned my meals for the rest of the week. I have bought lots of veggies and eggs. I've started cooking at each meal so let's see how long this lasts and when the backlash occurs.</p>
    <p>The rest of the week went pretty well and I even took a packed lunch to the shop consisting of eggs and made it up with orange peppers from the market. The weekend was tougher psychologically as that is when I do like to indulge. I fried up veggies in the morning and ate only one biscuit during my Samaritans shift. The craving was there and I could feel it but telling myself that I was only going to do it for a limited period helped me not to crack. I want to keep this up till I've lost the excess weight and then find an eating plan that allows me to eat the foods that I enjoy but at the same time isn't overindulgent and includes a good amount adequate nutrition.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Guitar</h4>
    <p>Goals: Play on two Sunday evenings and one weekday. Retrieve acoustic classical.</p>
    <p>It's the 2nd Sunday and I still haven't played but there is still time. I have however got in contact with my friend who I haven't seen in a long while and asked if he still has the classical. He said that he does still have it and that I can have it back at some point.</p>
    <p>Even though I now have the idea of playing the guitar and have some sort of vague plan, so far I still haven't played. This is really something that I don't want to force as I want it for fun and enjoyment rather than work on my scales or start working on grades etc.</p>
    <p>I did actually take the guitar down from its hook one evening and played it for all of 10 minutes. I enjoyed the sound and the physical sensation of my hands on the strings but the emotional engagement was low: I just wasn't feeling it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Meditation</h4>
    <p>Goals: Sit for 5 minutes every day. Keep a log of time of day.</p>
    <p>On average during the first week it has been 10 minutes or more.</p>
    <p>I missed quite a few days during that 3rd week between the 12-18. As it's such a short amount of time it's more about remembering rather than not having time.</p>
    <p>During the final week of the month it really wasn't something that I was inclined to do. I sat because it was on the list. I did tend to forget and whenever I did remember I would put it off and then of course forget. It was nice when I did indeed sit but nothing more than having a sit down on the sofa.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Goals: Work on mastering command line guides &amp; bash scripting.</p>
    <p>Over the first weekend, the 3rd and the 4th I went through my hard drives (one of my one-off goals for the month) and used primarily the command line to work my way through the contents. I moved movies that my daughter used to have when she had an account on my computer on to her laptop using rsync. Also changing permissions, ownerships and finding my way round all of this using the man pages rather than doing Google searches. This was very satisfying and gave me a sense that a lot can be achieved using the command line and that I'm not as much of a noob as I think I am.</p>
    <p>On the 5th, the Monday, a client of mine came to me with a MacBook Pro which had been malfunctioning. He had even taken it to the Apple store where they had informed him that the graphics hardware needed to be replaced. Faced with an expensive repair job that could possibly make the machine inoperable his first concern was to make sure that his data was backed up. I removed the hard drive and applied all that I had learned over the weekend about permissions and rsync and was able to copy all of his important (and not so important) data to an external portable hard drive that he had brought. We found a possible way to save the laptop without any major surgery and that would involve booting it with Arch Linux and getting the machine to use the built-in graphics hardware rather than the add-on. It involved using the command line for nearly the whole process and I learned how to create a bootloader using the dd command. I was successful in my attempt to revive the machine which was extremely rewarding and it made me feel that the study that I have been doing was very worthwhile and one of the main reasons why I was able to achieve the success that I did.</p>
    <p>I read through the chapter on tar (the archiving utility) and have been working through a bash scripting tutorial series. It's very basic but as I know very little about bash I don't mind that it's rudimentary.</p>
    <p>Been learning more command line and so on and getting excited about it. Even drifting off to sleep watching tutorials. How cool is that?</p>
    <p>During the final week I was still into it but was just too occupied with other things.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>Goals: Finish Bleak House and read Power to the People. Commit to a reading day.</p>
    <p>I've set a reading day for the 25th which is a Sunday following a twilight shift at Samaritans. When I set it in my calendar I was thinking of it as an optional reading day but now that I look at my goal I see the word commit. That scares me a little. But commit means commit.</p>
    <p>I was thinking about another possible reading day, today on the 11th but as I wanted to swap my strength training session to today from Monday and do some other things such as this I decided to leave it till the 25th. Who knows, I may have finished the book by then.</p>
    <p>I've been making very good progress with Bleak House especially now that it's getting very exciting as it reaches its conclusion and I've also been reading a couple of other books: Power to the People and Enter the Kettle bell. There is a third one but I think that I'll postpone that one till next month. I'm also wondering about audio books especially in conjunction with walking as I think it would be a good way to increase the amount that I want to read.</p>
    <p>More books have been added to my Kindle and I'm looking forward to reading them all.</p>
    <p>On Sunday February 25th I had a reading day. For some reason I slept very late and woke up at 11.00 but that didn't change much. I did a strength training session which I don't normally do on a Sunday but made it a little shorter than usual. I kept the computer off till later on in the day. Even while making breakfast I was already reading and continued into mid-afternoon. I took a brief trip to the shops and spent some time doing other things but late afternoon I finished Bleak House. Having finished this I immediately got the next Dickens on my list which (in the order they were written) is Hard Times. I believe that this is a much shorter work. I then continued by reading Power to the People and as it is very sparse compared to Dickens I moved through it pretty quickly and was even reading it in bed. Definitely a good day. Would have been nice to go outside to a pub or cafe but it was so nice to stay indoors while it was so cold outside.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do a shift at Waltham Forest. Tweet on Mondays.</p>
    <p>It's Wednesday the 7th and I haven't tweeted for my branch.</p>
    <p>Well, I have my reminder to tweet set for next week and yesterday I conducted yet another peer review at my branch for one of my colleagues. The quality of service that we provide is still impeccable.</p>
    <p>I didn't tweet this week either and it's already the middle of the week and I can't see myself doing it. Last night I had one of those shifts where I didn't get any 'good calls'. At our branch (and I imagine at other branches too) we Samaritans term calls that are worthwhile or genuine as 'good calls'. The caller will be genuinely distressed, struggling or in desperate need. At the other end of the scale the caller may just want to chat, have only minor concerns or simply want to rant. My calls were of the latter description and when you receive many of such calls in succession it can seem as though the service we provide is being totally misused. Good thing that it isn't like this all the time and that there is a genuine need out there and for those callers the service that we provide is indispensable.</p>
    <p>On Monday 26th I finally wrote a tweet for our branch. It was actually a lot of fun to look through our Twitter account and work on it a little bit. It shouldn't be hard to make it a regular thing. As for Waltham Forest I've missed that one this month. Will have to carry that one over.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Sleep</h4>
    <p>Goals: Keep track of bedtime &amp; sleep hours along with any notes.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I sleep a little and sometimes I sleep a lot but by the end of the month I'll have some real figures. What I'll make of them I don't know but I'm still collecting data for now.</p>
    <p>I've been having some late nights but don't know if it matters that much as my goal isn't to go to bed earlier but only to record and observe.</p>
    <p>Just having a look through my records so far I can see that I have an average amount of sleep of 7 hours. I don't set an alarm so I could sleep longer but I wake up whenever my body says that I'm ready to wake up. I'm still very much enjoying the dream life afforded by the zinc supplementation.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to looking through the data that I've collected.</p>
    <p>Even though I was only collecting data this month I found that I was generally going to bed a bit earlier than usual. I still ended up watching YouTube on my phone till I had to make myself stop but on some occasions I did manage to avoid it and just read a bit or simply close my eyes.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>Goals: Do at least one extra hand stand session &amp; pull up GTG. Grippers. Limbering up first thing.</p>
    <p>The limbering up first thing is great. It only takes me about 5 minutes or less but really sets me up for the morning pages, especially stretching the hands.</p>
    <p>Using Pavel's ideas is making my training sessions much more enjoyable. I'm a lot more absorbed in how my body is working in terms of whether all the muscles are tightening, such as my butt. During my second session in week 1 on the 7th of February, I did pull-ups with the vacuum cleaner strapped around my waist. I got three very strict reps out but didn't attempt a fourth because he says that you shouldn't really be working to failure. In the past that would have made me feel that I was slacking off but thinking that I'm working to build my strength rather than my size I don't mind. I do sort of want to get bigger but really I want to be stronger without necessarily getting bigger. I also only did two sets.</p>
    <p>More reps on the pull-ups with the vacuum cleaner attached and on Saturday 10th I bought a kettle bell. I've been dipping into a book called Enter the Kettle Bell also by Pavel I got a 16kg cast iron one from Argos which I then carried home on the bus; felt like carrying a small but compact suitcase.</p>
      <p>I've added the kettlebell to my routine. I've taken out the squats and am now doing kettlebell swings and kettlebell sumo deadlifts. Gets my heartrate up and leaves me swaggering a little.</p>
      <p>There was some pain in my right shoulder for a few days but using the kettlebell seemed to clear it. Think that my body is adjusting to the heavier weight. As I still haven't completed my year plan I was wondering what I'd like to achieve strength wise and where I would like to be in year's time but my main response was to maintain my routine. I used to have a goal of being able to do some of the gymnastic movements such as the muscle up and the lever but don't seem to care about them now.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday 20th I watched lots of tutorials on how to correctly perform the kettlebell swing and the turkish get up. The get up looks like a lot of fun and I spent some time following the tutorials and consequently wore myself out.</p>
      <p>On Saturday 24th I worked on my handstands. There was a day where I was able to balance for a tiny bit longer and it felt so much longer than that. I counted 6 seconds but it felt as though I could actually balance totally unsupported.</p>
      <p>The session I did on the 25th was a tiny bit shorter but I took the opportunity to try some new things such as the Turkish get-up. I've been studying it all week and have been practising without the kettlebell. I tried a half get-up using the actual kettlebell and found myself shaking and trembling so clearly a lot more practice to do. I have already improved a lot on the swing. But I'm noticing how I seem to be veering away a little (perhaps a lot) from my original bodyweight training programme. I'm wondering if I should have one session as I'm doing now made up of both kettlebell and bodyweight exercises or split them into separate sessions. Might be in a better place to make a decision once I have finished the Power to the People book.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Goals: Twice weekly Typescout and once alphabet exercise.</p>
      <p>I tried the alphabet exercise but found it to be much harder than I thought. You have to type the alphabet from a to z without making a mistake. If you do make a mistake then you simply start again on the next line. I managed to get three lines in a row but that was my best. Wow, this was a real eye opener. I'll definitely be trying this one again.</p>
      <p>During week 3 (12-18) I didn't even do any typing practice. For some reason it got sidelined.</p>
      <p>This week, week 4, I've done a session and have noticed how my right hand tends to move away from a home row a lot and thus makes my right shoulder a little tense. Reaching the enter and backspace keys with the little finger involves taking my right forefinger off the j key (h in dvorak) and then taking a moment to find it again. I think this should now be my focus. My left hand seems to stay relaxed and remain on the home row.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Walking</h4>
    <p>Goals: 10k steps twice a week.</p>
    <p>I surpassed the 10k on Friday and walked in excess of 14k but on the other days I was lower than the 10k. I had an idea of instead making the goal 20k for the whole week. Nah, that's no challenge.</p>
    <p>On Monday and Tuesday, 12 and 13 I have already completed my 10k steps.</p>
    <p>It was disappointing to see that walking uses hardly any calories: 10k steps amounts to about 100. But if Eliot Hulse recommends it then I say why not and as I'm not really riding my bike I need some sort of cardio in my life even if it is low level.</p>
    <p>On Friday 23rd I managed 15k and on the Thursday before that it was 9.7k which I think is close enough to 10k so I'm counting it. I'm sort of only half interested in this goal. I don't particularly enjoy it that much but it does help to feel fitter and to feel that my body is capable of walking rather than having to take transport of some form. It's a good way to distance myself from all the worries and cares of my life and also a chance to listen to audio books. Not that audio books should only be enjoyed while walking but I seem to have made that association. Two birds with one stone so that is great.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>Goals: Always do corpse. Create one long and one short session.</p>
    <p>I have been doing my practice and I have been using the timer as well as doing the corpse at the end of the session but I seem to have forgotten all about making routines. Time to get out a paper and pen.</p>
    <p>Still no routine but I'm keeping it up and it really is starting to become more like a practice again rather than a set of mild stretches that are added on to a TV show. Doing the corpse does make quite a big difference to how it feels.</p>
    <p>I did miss my session a couple of times in the final week and did a very short session on Sunday 25th. I think this is a prime reason why I should have two sessions ready at hand for those times when I just don't feel like it and don't really know what I should be doing. Bit like having the odd ready meal in the freezer. Applying 80/20 thinking to this problem I could identify which postures would be the most effective and if I had a very short session then at least I could do those very effective postures.</p>
    <p>I found that I wasn't quite as engaged with the yoga by the end of the month as I was at the start. It's not a disengagement as with the guitar for example but I started to find myself going through the motions a bit, missing sessions and leaving out the corpse.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>Goals: Buy shoes. Take a cold shower. Set reminders for hosting clients. Read about peer to peer lending. Set up spoke cutting page. Complete year plan. Think about what could be removed from my life. Complete the hard drive audit.</p>
    <p>During the first weekend I did the hard drive audit. It was very enjoyable to browse them via the command line and move some things around. The plan was to move things on to fewer discs and then discard the rest it's not easy. I did manage to destroy one drive which was a lot of fun. They only sell for pennies on eBay. I've also set up reminders to remind my hosting clients that they need to renew.</p>
    <p>On the morning of Saturday 10th I took a cold shower. I didn't fully put myself under the water but managed to get my arms and legs there. When it came to torso that was another matter. It certainly was invigorating and I'm keen to try again, this time going fully under the water with my whole body.</p>
    <p>I had a look at shoes in a sports shop today (14th) but there were so many that I couldn't decide. I've been thinking a lot about the year plan and how to write it and how to use it but keep going from pillar to post really.</p>
    <p>I think that I might hold off with looking into peer to peer lending because I want to read Tony Robbins book about investing. It might be something to look into anyway but as I have so many things that I want to work on this month I think it's better to reduce rather than add.</p>
    <p>On Monday 19th I ordered a new pair of shoes. I went for a timeless classic the Chuck Taylor Converse in maroon. Turned out to be a lot cheaper on eBay than at the shops and as well as having considered this one as a strong contender it was also recommended by Pavel in his book, "Enter the Kettlebell". Also on Monday, I wrote a draft for my spoke cutting page. I don't have any suitable images which was one reason I was holding off but then thought that there wasn't really any reason why I should work on the images before writing the copy. I just need a PayPal form on the page so that people can order spokes directly from the page itself.</p>
    <p>On Tuesday 20th I moved forward a great deal with the year plan. It's not complete but I would say that it is around 80% there. I moved some of the ideas that I'd dumped into the draft into their appropriate sections such as one-off goals and principles and soon I could feel it all shaping up. I decided to make the format more like a month plan than a year plan and to consider the year like a long month, this plan being only for 10 months.</p>
    <p>While I was in the bath I had a realisation, that there is a difference between what I want to do and what I want to get done. I was thinking about what I was going to do when I had got out of the bath and there was a choice between either watching TV series or following bash scripting tutorials. I was expecting that the pull toward TV series would be the greater especially as it was toward the end of the day and when I'm tired I'm more easily lured by entertainment rather than focus and productivity but in this instance the pull felt very equal; it really felt like a choice. As I focused on that feeling of pull, equal pull toward each choice, I could feel the pull toward each of my goals, some of which were strong and others so weak that they were like a dying sputtering candle flame. The stronger ones I called the ones that I genuinely wanted to do and would probably do without setting them up as formal goals. The others I guess could be removed and I wouldn't even notice. It reminds me of the story of the wife donating her husbands things to charity. He was shocked when he found out but she didn't tell him which items she had given away. She asked him to tell her what he was missing and she would tell him whether she had given it away. He racked his brains but couldn't name any item that he missed. She simply smiled and shrugged. This gives me a good working strategy to help me eliminate things from my life, things that use up time and resources which could otherwise be spent on the things that I really wanted to do at that time.</p>

<p>February 2018 is essentially a continuation from January with only some small changes. Even though I still haven't written the year plan for this year January went rather well so I'm riding on that wave and have set up February accordingly. I am tracking a few goals daily, namely Sleep, Diet and Meditation on a Google sheet. Just to gather data which might help me to set goals for March.</p>
<p>One thing that did confuse me when I had set a goal that was defined as 2-3 times a week was when exactly was a week? Would it start on a Sunday or a Monday? Years ago I used to start my week on Sundays because it was a working day. But now it's a Monday. What happens when a week is made up of the end of one month and the start of another? If the goal of the previous month is carried over then those 2 months are like one long month but otherwise I suppose there would have to be an overlap.</p>

<p>During the final 3 months of 2016 I neglected my year plan and my goals for the year. I did not set any particular targets for the month and did not review at the end of the month. This however did not deter my efforts and I continued with my ongoing goals such as strength training, yoga and typing. The fact that some goals are long established and would go on regardless of whether I had a plan made me question the idea of even having a plan for the year. But rather than abandon the strategy altogether I do find it to be useful as an overview, especially reading through it at the end of each month before writing my review. Perhaps I just needed a break from it because when the end of the year finally came I was missing my structure and was looking forward to re-establishing it again in 2017.</p>
<p>What I have decided to do this year is to be a bit gentler on myself and generally lower my expectations. For example, last year I read 5 out of a possible 17 works by Charles Dickens, my goal having been 12 (one each month). But I had expected to reach 17. I also achieved a great deal with my cyling goals but expected more. This is unrealistic and my plan is not only to lower my expectations of myself but also of others. It's a constant source of frustration and of disappointment and takes my focus away from what actually is possible and most probable.</p>
<p>The 5:2 diet (which I will continue this year) has taught me to focus beyond one year; in fact two years as an initial goal, but then beyond and ideally the rest of my life. I imagine that I feel the same about some of my other goals such as yoga and reading. If I make the goal too difficult for myself to achieve in one year, then perhaps I can spread it out over two. This is what I decided to do with my goal of reading the works of Dickens. But doing that led me to consider another idea, that of an appraisal and review of the plan itself. As such, I have decided to break the year into thirds and ask myself if I still wanted to achieve the goals I had set for myself. A year can be a long time to work on something and even after a few months one may find that the initial enthusiasm and interest has waned a great amount. Probably even sooner than that.</p>
<p>As is usual, I made some notes during the final month of the year to help me to formulate my plan for the forthcoming year. The first are some guiding principles and they will apply to all of my goals. I have already mentioned some of these ideas but will list them for easier reference during my end of month re-reading and review.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be realistic about what is possible without making it too easy</li>
  <li>For ongoing goals think beyond 2017; tortoise / hare</li>
  <li>Progress in yoga takes many years, there is no quick fix</li>
  <li>Limit or filter new ideas</li>
  <li>Lower my expectations</li>
  <li>Learn to trust my gut instincts more</li>
  <li>Appraise and review my goals every 4 months</li>
  <li>Be aware of honeymoon periods waning</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of limiting or filtering new ideas ties in with the principle of being aware of honeymoon periods waning and keeping my life clutter free. There are many things that I want to achieve but each one requires commitment and I am already committed to some things. Adding new goals could mean that existing ones will suffer due to time and energy available, so being a little cautious about saying yes to a new idea is no bad thing.</p>
<p>One year, just like one month or one minute is only one unit of time in a stream that we perceive as endless but where our own existence is finite. Having maintained my goals for the past two years I imagine that I will want to continue with them year after year and rather than come to a halt at the end of 2017 I am assuming that they will be carried over into 2018 and beyond. Therefore I am looking for a level of commitment that is realistic and one that I can maintain. Of course, there is scope for change, especially if my interest dwindles to zero but at the time of writing I am clear that I want to continue with these aims.</p>
<p>Specifically, for the next few months, here they are.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>At our branch, volunteers come and go but some seem to remain and become long standing stalwarts. I want to be part of that elite group and the only way to achieve that is to play the long game. I have already taken on many other things on top of my shifts which can sometimes feel a little overburdened but I do want to keep going with it. I will need to undertake some Ongoing Training (OGT) this year to maintain my active status so that is the first thing on my list. I will continue to be a mentor and take on mentees every other intake. I am Fundraising Lead so I have that responsibility too and will continue with that but take a step back when things have been set up. I would also like to see how things are done at other branches and make a point of paying them a visit.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>I want to carry over my goal from last year of doing at least 2 sessions a week. I seem to be happy to do more than that but 2 is the goal. Last year I also set a goal of 75 wpm but it was way too ambitious, especially for a twice a week practice. My current wpm is just over 55 and I think it should be possible to get that up to a steady 60 wpm by the end of the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Due to the lack of interest and activity in 2016, I wondered about taking this one off the list entirely: retiring the idea. But when I spend even a few minutes programming in whatever language, I do get excited. So I'm going to keep it up but do it purely for pleasure and cover areas that really interest me rather than those that may prove to be good for a CV. And rather than trying to force myself to achieve 20 hours a week I am aiming for 2-3 slots a week of only 1 hour. Perhaps like typing I will do more than that.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>The goal of reading one book a month has been my goal for the past few years. Sometimes I have managed but it is not one that I think is realistic. Some books are easier to read and some are harder and longer. Some days I read a lot and others not at all. I would prefer to be more consistent and even if I read for only 20-30 minutes a day, that would suffice, so long as it was every day. I don't think I could cover the 3-4% required to complete the book in a month but that makes it too focused on quantity rather than on quality. I want to get myself immersed in the authors world and appreciate the time that they took to craft those sentences. I may end up reading more than my goal but a little each day is preferable to a lot now and then. I like the idea of keeping track of new words but can't really see myself staying on top of it. I also like the idea of a Reading Day and perhaps in the summer I may actually do it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>The main goal is to continue with the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet but not put myself under any great pressure for the other 5 days. Last year I was creeping along and attempting to put a meal plan in place. At one point I had a good balance of healthy and unhealthy elements. I took it one step further and tipped that balance towards being fully healthy. It did work for a while but it all tipped the other way and left me hankering after junk food for all of my 5 non-fasting days. I will be setting my sights lower this year and my plan is to have one healthy eating day a week which will be Wednesday. The rules are to keep sugar, fat and salt low as well as pre-packed and processed foods. Five-a-day, high fibre and not overeating.</p>
    <p>I have a second experimental goal which is to create a diet based around eggs. Why eggs? Because they are high in protein, I like them and they are cheap. At some point in the year I will try it for 4-6 weeks and see how it goes. Obviously with no pressure to make it an ongoing thing.</p>
    <p>A third dietary experiment is to try creatine. This one is very much optional.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Strength</h4>
    <p>I have been following the Reddit recommened body-weight training routine for many months and will continue to do so and upgrade exercises when I can perform 3x8 reps. It's been a good staple and it's good not to keep changing things too often when you're onto a good thing. I do want to have a try at adding extra volume and doing max sets at some point and find a way of making that part of my routine, perhaps once a month or twice. Some say that without the nutrition counterpart I am hampering my progress which is another reason to try the high protein month. As mentioned in the diet section, I would like to try creatine supplementation at some point too.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p>Now that I have completed most of the popular Audax challenges I am wondering where to go next. The last few rides of 2016 left me in a conflicted state of feeling bored in spite of enjoying the ride. It would be nice to complete RRtY without aiming to do so i.e. riding because I'm excited about it and later finding that I didn't have a break. This year, there is a famous Audax calendar event called LEL or London-Edinburgh-London. The event itself will take place in July but entry to the event is in January. The distance is something like 1400 km and it is fully catered along with showers, sleep stops and bag drops. It comes every four years and given the amount of riding that I have been doing the past couple of years, I think that with only a little training I should be capable of completing it. But the question is whether I want to. I imagine that it would be a once in a lifetime experience and even though it may come again in 2021 I may have gone off distance cycling by then. It's a hefty &pound;329 to enter and would give me a clear target for the year rather like someone entering the London Marathon. Who know, I may shake the cycling boredom and experience pure cycling bliss.</p>
    <p>So the goal remains unset for now. If I don't enter LEL does that mean I quit Audax? Is Audax all of my cycling? Could I try touring or mountain biking? I do want to continue to cycle and I do want to achieve some sort of target but not sure what yet. If I don't enter LEL it may well be another RRtY. And rollers once a week?</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clutter Clearing</h4>
    <p>Sporadic success with this goal led me to think that either I had no more to discard or that my strategy was flawed. Well, I certainly do have a lot more clutter that needs to be addressed and I do need a new strategy. My Friday morning reminder did no more than startle me each week and left me feeling that it was never going to happen. I have realised that dealing with clutter isn't only about getting rid of it. There is clutter that you want to keep and that always confused me. That kind of clutter can be organised and tidied. My goal is to do something every day, however small. It could be chucking something out or tidying. I'm keeping a list so I can see what I did.</p>
    <p>Going from a weekly goal to a daily one seems as though I have highered rather than lowered my expectations but let's see how we go.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga</h4>
    <p>2016 was more about maintenance rather than progress but then it's a long established practice. I seem to have been half-hearted and done it in an unfocused way combining it with watching something. But I don't do that with strength training: I am focused for the entire session. Could I not do the same with yoga? No screen time, totally focused and follow a routine? Asking too much? Why is that not asking too much when it comes to strengh training? One can only try it out. If my practice falls apart as a result then I will have to re-evaluate it but perhaps it could work. It's only a trial of a few months anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
    <p>These are ideas that have been on my list for years mostly and either get carried over or just forgotten. I would like to get them done this year but at the same time I am not going to put myself under any great pressure to do so. Here they are.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Beach holiday</li>
      <li>Buy new clothes</li>
      <li>Eating out at restaurants</li>
      <li>Doing more cooking</li>
      <li>Getting my teeth done</li>
      <li>Visiting friends out of town</li>
      <li>Go on a yoga or meditation retreat</li>
      <li>Earning more money</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The last time I had any sort of holiday was at the end of 2009 when I went to visit my then holiday cottage in Sweden. It was a birthday weekend for myself and other than the odd overnight stay with a friend I haven't had what might be considered a holiday for about 7 years. My favourite kind of holidays are those where I do very little. I enjoy the scenery, read, think, go for walks and swim if there is a beach. If it faces West then I enjoy the sunset. It would be great if I could arrange such a holiday.</p>
    <p>Since doing the 5:2 diet I have lost a lot of weight and nearly all of my clothes feel baggy and many sizes too big. I plan to stay at this weight and given that I haven't bought new clothes for some time, the ones that I do have are getting quite shabby and starting to fall apart. Clothes shopping is not something that I enjoy very much so I tend to avoid it but this should only involve replacing the clothes that I have lost one item at a time.</p>
    <p>In the latter half of 2016 I began to indulge in junk food, especially take aways from the chippy. It's cheap and on the whole fairly comforting but it would be nice to better the quality somewhat. The chain restaurants such as Wagamama and Yo Sushi that Maya also likes would be a good start but also places that are more exclusive and off the beaten track. Not necessarily expensive but definitely those recommended by friends.</p>
    <p>I used to do a lot of cooking and used to enjoy cooking for others either at home or even at their homes. I did exactly that towards the end of 2016 and enjoy conversations about new recipes and ingredients, food preparation and cuisine in general. Added to my plan of eating more healthily one day a week I would like to get my cooking mojo back both cooking for myself and for others.</p>
    <p>In 2016 I had one episode of severe toothache and it was the only time that I went to the dentist. It was a chance to try out a new dentist but also a means to get antibiotics. I cancelled the follow up appointment and my teeth remain in great need of treatment. I have at least 4 cavities that need filling, no doubt increasing in size by the minute. I'm sure there are other issues a good dentist would discover if I would allow them time inside my mouth. I would really like to get my teeth done but I can see me reaching the end of the year with no progress at all.</p>
    <p>Months can fly by without a word from good friends who live in other locales. It takes some time and effort to plan a trip especially for one who doesn't travel much. But spending time with old friends is such a treat. It seems easy in principle but life will conspire to keep putting it off till another year has passed.</p>
    <p>During my twenties I was involved in Buddhism and would attend retreats, sometimes with others and sometimes on my own. It was a way to take oneself away from the day to day and focus on practice. I often think of these retreats very fondly and miss that atmosphere. I think it would be interesting to see what I made of it now. I could even go to one that I have visited long ago.</p>
    <p>During 2015 and 2016 my main goals were cycling. I put many other things to one side in order to pursue those rides. This year I feel less focused on cycling and am beginning to notice how my focus has drifted away from paid work. It's a necessary evil and allows for many other things. But how do I want to earn that extra money? More yoga classes? More wheels or more websites? Or a combination of all as I do already? Or something that is totally new?</p>
  </li>
  <p>I feel very confident about this plan and that it is open to revision. I look forward to putting it to work and reaping the benefits. Let's get started.</p>
</ul>

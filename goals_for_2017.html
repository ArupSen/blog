<p>During the final 3 months of 2016 I neglected my year plan and my goals for the year. I did not set any particular targets for the month and did not review at the end of the month. This however did not deter my efforts and I continued with my ongoing goals such as strength training, yoga and typing. The fact that some goals are long established and would go on regardless of whether I had a plan made me question the idea of even having a plan for the year. But rather than abandon the strategy altogether I do find it to be useful as an overview, especially reading through it at the end of each month before writing my review. Perhaps I just needed a break from it because when the end of the year finally came I was missing my structure and was looking forward to re-establishing it again in 2017.</p>
<p>What I have decided to do this year is to be a bit gentler on myself and generally lower my expectations. For example, last year I read 5 out of a possible 17 works by Charles Dickens, my goal having been 12 (one each month). But I had expected to reach 17. I also achieved a great deal with my cyling goals but expected more. This is unrealistic and my plan is not only to lower my expectations of myself but also of others. It's a constant source of frustration and of disappointment and takes my focus away from what actually is possible and most probable.</p>
<p>The 5:2 diet (which I will continue this year) has taught me to focus beyond one year; in fact two years as an initial goal, but then beyond and ideally the rest of my life. I imagine that I feel the same about some of my other goals such as yoga and reading. If I make the goal too difficult for myself to achieve in one year, then perhaps I can spread it out over two. This is what I decided to do with my goal of reading the works of Dickens. But doing that led me to consider another idea, that of an appraisal and review of the plan itself. As such, I have decided to break the year into thirds and ask myself if I still wanted to achieve the goals I had set for myself. A year can be a long time to work on something and even after a few months one may find that the initial enthusiasm and interest has waned a great amount. Probably even sooner than that.</p>
<p>As is usual, I made some notes during the final month of the year to help me to formulate my plan for the forthcoming year. The first are some guiding principles and they will apply to all of my goals. I have already mentioned some of these ideas but will list them for easier reference during my end of month re-reading and review.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be realistic about what is possible without making it too easy</li>
  <li>For ongoing goals think beyond 2017; tortoise / hare</li>
  <li>Progress in yoga takes many years, there is no quick fix</li>
  <li>Limit or filter new ideas</li>
  <li>Lower my expectations</li>
  <li>Learn to trust my gut instincts more</li>
  <li>Appraise and review my goals every 4 months</li>
  <li>Be aware of honeymoon periods waning</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of limiting or filtering new ideas ties in with the principle of being aware of honeymoon periods waning and keeping my life clutter free. There are many things that I want to achieve but each one requires commitment and I am already committed to some things. Adding new goals could mean that existing ones will suffer due to time and energy available, so being a little cautious about saying yes to a new idea is no bad thing.</p>
<p>One year, just like one month or one minute is only one unit of time in a stream that we perceive as endless but where our own existence is finite. Having maintained my goals for the past two years I imagine that I will want to continue with them year after year and rather than come to a halt at the end of 2017 I am assuming that they will be carried over into 2018 and beyond. Therefore I am looking for a level of commitment that is realistic and one that I can maintain. Of course, there is scope for change, especially if my interest dwindles to zero but at the time of writing I am clear that I want to continue with these aims.</p>
<p>Specifically, for the next few months, here they are.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>At our branch, volunteers come and go but some seem to remain and become long standing stalwarts. I want to be part of that elite group and the only way to achieve that is to play the long game. I have already taken on many other things on top of my shifts which can sometimes feel a little overburdened but I do want to keep going with it. I will need to undertake some Ongoing Training (OGT) this year to maintain my active status so that is the first thing on my list. I will continue to be a mentor and take on mentees every other intake. I am Fundraising Lead so I have that responsibility too and will continue with that but take a step back when things have been set up. I would also like to see how things are done at other branches and make a point of paying them a visit.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>I want to carry over my goal from last year of doing at least 2 sessions a week. I seem to be happy to do more than that but 2 is the goal. Last year I also set a goal of 75 wpm but it was way too ambitious, especially for a twice a week practice. My current wpm is just over 55 and I think it should be possible to get that up to a steady 60 wpm by the end of the year.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Due to the lack of interest and activity in 2016, I wondered about taking this one off the list entirely: retiring the idea. But when I spend even a few minutes programming in whatever language, I do get excited. So I'm going to keep it up but do it purely for pleasure and cover areas that really interest me rather than those that may prove to be good for a CV. And rather than trying to force myself to achieve 20 hours a week I am aiming for 2-3 slots a week of only 1 hour. Perhaps like typing I will do more than that.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>The goal of reading one book a month has been my goal for the past few years. Sometimes I have managed but it is not one that I think is realistic. Some books are easier to read and some are harder and longer. Some days I read a lot and others not at all. I would prefer to be more consistent and even if I read for only 20-30 minutes a day, that would suffice, so long as it was every day. I don't think I could cover the 3-4% required to complete the book in a month but that makes it too focused on quantity rather than on quality. I want to get myself immersed in the authors world and appreciate the time that they took to craft those sentences. I may end up reading more than my goal but a little each day is preferable to a lot now and then. I like the idea of keeping track of new words but can't really see myself staying on top of it. I also like the idea of a Reading Day and perhaps in the summer I may actually do it.</p>
